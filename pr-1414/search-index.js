For complete information on the Starknet Node API in JSON RPC format, see starknet_api_openrpc.json on Github. See also RPC An ordered set of Starknet transactions. Blocks are built by the sequencer. A block has the following identifiers: block hash A unique identifier that can be used to query and refer to the block. block number A number representing the location of the block in the sequence of accepted blocks in Starknet. An optimized low-level execution unit that is added to the Cairo CPU board to perform predefined computations that are expensive to perform in standard Cairo, including range-checks, Pedersen hash calculations, and ECDSA. The smallest unit of execution within the Cairo VM, typically involving mathematical, logical, or control-flow operations that collectively define the behavior of a program. The Cairo Virtual Machine (VM) is software that knows how to execute compiled Cairo byte-code. The result of this execution is the program trace that can then be sent to a STARK prover in order to prove the validity of the instruction expressed in the Cairo code. The definition of a contract. It includes Cairo byte code, entry point names, and everything that defines its semantics. A deployed contract that corresponds to a class. Only contract instances act as true contracts, in that they have their own storage and can be called by transactions or other contracts. The smallest denomination of STRK. 1 fri = 10-18 STRK. A machine that runs the Starknet execution protocol. A full node stays synchronized with the latest state of the network, stores past blocks and transactions, and enables users to interact with the network, such as by querying its state or by broadcasting new transactions. The base layer of a blockchain network, such as Ethereum, where transactions are directly recorded and validated. It includes the underlying protocol and consensus mechanism that establish the foundational rules for the blockchain. Exists on top of an L1 blockchain, such as Ethereum, in order to add value to the L1, by providing features such as massive computation scale without compromising on Ethereum’s composability and security. A single transaction that executes multiple bundled transactions, which are signed once on Starknet. If one call fails, the entire operation is aborted. The entity that receives the output of Cairo programs and generates proofs to be verified. In the context of Starknet, the prover generates proofs of the computational integrity of the work performed by the sequencer. It then submits the proof to the verifier on L1, which registers the fact. See also SHARP verifier The Starknet RPC API provides clients an interface to retrieve information on the state of the chain and to interact with it, such as by posting transactions or estimating the fee of a transaction before it is sent. See also API A set of services that together receive transactions from the network, put them in order, check their validity, and build blocks. The Shared Prover (SHARP) is a mechanism used in Starknet that aggregates multiple Cairo programs from different users, each containing different logic. These Cairo programs are then executed together, generating a single proof common to all the programs. An intermediate representation between Cairo and Casm. Sierra code is then compiled into a Casm program with the property that, for any input, the program’s execution is provable. In particular, it ensures that the execution of a transaction is provable regardless of whether the execution succeeded or was reverted due to an error. Additional resources Cairo and Sierra A proof system that uses cryptography to provide polylogarithmic verification resources and proof size, with minimal and post-quantum-secure assumptions. A smart contract deployed on Ethereum. Its address is 0xc662c410c0ecf747543f5ba90660f6abebd9c8c4. It defines the state of Starknet by storing: The commitment to the L2 state. The Starknet OS program hash – effectively defines the version of Starknet the network is running. The committed state on the L1 Core Contract acts as the consensus mechanism of Starknet, that is, the system is secured by the L1 Ethereum consensus. In addition to maintaining the state, the Starknet L1 Core Contract is the main hub of operations for Starknet on L1. Specifically: It stores the list of allowed verifier contracts that can verify state update transactions It deals with cross-layer interaction between L1 and L2. A permissionless Validity-Rollup, also known as a zero-knowledge rollup (ZK rollup) for Ethereum. Starknet is a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain, enabling any dApp to achieve massive computation scale without compromising Ethereum’s composability and security. Starknet aims to achieve secure, low-cost transactions and high performance by using the STARK cryptographic proof system. Starknet contracts and the Starknet OS are written in Cairo, a custom-built and specialized programming language. The Cairo program that, upon receiving a set of transaction as input, executes the state transition. For more information, see Starknet state. The integrity of this computation is what is actually proven and verified. The set of all the contracts' code and all the memory slots and their values, in every contract’s storage. See also Starknet state A transaction can be seen as a message containing a set of instructions that describe a state transition. The Starknet protocol has the following types of transactions, which affect different parts of the state: DECLARE INVOKE DEPLOY_ACCOUNT See also Transaction types Starknet state The data describing the difference between two states. It contains information on every contract whose storage was updated and additional information on contract deployments. A unit of measurement of proving complexity. In the STARK protocol, a computation is translated into an execution trace that must satisfy a collection of constraints. Every Cairo step translates to ~50 trace cells. A set of L1 smart contracts whose purpose is to verify STARK proofs submitted by the Shared Prover (SHARP).","title":"Glossary","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"glossary","url":"/glossary/","titles":[{"text":"account abstraction","hash":"account-abstraction","id":1},{"text":"account contract","hash":"account_contract","id":2},{"text":"API","hash":"api","id":3},{"text":"block","hash":"block","id":4},{"text":"builtin","hash":"builtin","id":5},{"text":"Cairo step","hash":"cairo-step","id":6},{"text":"Cairo VM","hash":"cairovm","id":7},{"text":"contract class","hash":"contract_class","id":8},{"text":"contract instance","hash":"contract_instance","id":9},{"text":"fri","hash":"fri","id":10},{"text":"full node","hash":"full-node","id":11},{"text":"Layer 1, L1","hash":"l1","id":12},{"text":"Layer 2, L2","hash":"l2","id":13},{"text":"multicall","hash":"multicall","id":14},{"text":"prover","hash":"prover","id":15},{"text":"RPC","hash":"rpc","id":16},{"text":"sequencer","hash":"sequencer","id":17},{"text":"SHARP","hash":"SHARP","id":18},{"text":"Sierra","hash":"sierra","id":19},{"text":"STARK","hash":"stark","id":20},{"text":"Starknet L1 Core Contract","hash":"starknet-l1-core-contract","id":21},{"text":"Starknet","hash":"starknet","id":22},{"text":"Starknet OS","hash":"starknet-os","id":23},{"text":"Starknet state","hash":"starknet-state","id":24},{"text":"transaction","hash":"transaction","id":25},{"text":"state diff","hash":"statediff","id":26},{"text":"trace cell","hash":"trace-cells","id":27},{"text":"verifier","hash":"verifier","id":28}]},"2":{"id":2,"text":"Starknet is a permissionless Validity-Rollup, also known as a zero-knowledge rollup (ZK rollup) for Ethereum.

For more details on Starknet’s governance processes see the Starknet Governance Hub. This document describes certain economic fundamentals of the Starknet token. This document is intended for informational purposes only and is meant to outline the usage and functionalities of the asset within Starknet. It is important to understand that the primary purpose of the Starknet token, STRK, is to facilitate operations and activities on Starknet and it is not intended to serve as an investment. Blockchains work through a combination of cryptography and economic incentives. Cryptography limits what actors in the system can do, for example, transactions must be validly signed to be included in the chain. Economic incentives encourage actors to voluntarily perform actions that maintain the network’s capabilities when spending their own resources, for example, miners or stakers actively publish new blocks to the chain because they can receive fees and new tokens as a reward. Blockchains are valuable because they are data structures maintained by diverse and, ideally, large groups of otherwise unaffiliated persons. This gives them resilience: Any one participant can disappear, but the data structure is preserved. This also gives them censorship resistance: No single person can unilaterally decide to forbid certain persons from using the network. Starknet operates as a Layer 2 (L2) network on top of Ethereum. Today, Starknet achieves secure low-cost transactions by using the STARK cryptographic proof system to reduce the size of transaction data while preserving and verifying the integrity of that data. Still under development, Starknet will achieve resilience and censorship resistance by using a token, the Starknet token (STRK), to incentivize network participants to sequence transactions for users of the network and to ensure that there is a provably fair mechanism, a proof-of-stake mechanism, to determine who should sequence and submit a proof for the network blocks. A proof-of-stake mechanism might also be used to facilitate data availability solutions and other significant services required for network operations. STRK is the mechanism for paying fees to enable operation of the network, maintaining and securing the network by enabling staking for consensus, and deciding on Starknet’s values and technology goals by voting for governance proposals. Transaction fees: Originally, fees in Starknet were paid only in Ether (ETH). As of v.0.13.0, fees for transactions on the network can be paid using STRK, as well as ETH. A portion of the fees paid in STRK are converted to ETH by the receiving sequencer, in order to cover Ethereum L1 gas costs, which, due to the specifications of the Ethereum protocol, must be paid in ETH. Staking: Certain services that are critical to the liveness and security of Starknet may require the staking of Starknet tokens. These services might be offered by multiple providers, and could include sequencing, reaching temporary L2 consensus before L1 finality is reached, STARK-proving services, and data availability provisioning, to name a few examples. These protocol changes are still under discussion within the larger governance community and are targeted for 2024 -2025. Governance: Proposals for improving Starknet might require a minimal token support threshold. Voting, either directly or via delegation, will be required for changes to the protocol that are essential to Starknet’s liveness, security, and maintenance. Today, for example, major updates to the Starknet Operating System require the approval of token holders. For more information about Governance see the Starknet Governance Hub As discussed above, the Starknet tokens are digital assets intended to support the operation and usage of Starknet and are not offered as an investment. As such, the Starknet tokens do not represent any equity in StarkWare or the Starknet Foundation, nor do they provide any participation right in StarkWare or grant any right of claim from StarkWare or the Starknet Foundation. Ten billion Starknet tokens were initially created by StarkWare in May 2022 and minted onchain on November 30, 2022. The existing ten billion tokens have been or are planned to be distributed according to the following: 20.04%: Early Contributors Tokens allocated for StarkWare’s team members and early contributors. These tokens are subject to a lock-up schedule, as further detailed below. 18.17%: Investors Tokens allocated for StarkWare’s investors. These tokens are subject to a lock-up schedule, as further detailed below. 10.76%: StarkWare Tokens allocated for StarkWare for operation services such as to pay fees, provide other services on Starknet, and engage other service providers. 12.93%: Grants including Development Partners (aka DPs) Tokens allocated for grants for research or work done to develop, test, deploy and maintain the Starknet protocol. The process for applications and allocations related to Starknet Foundation Grants will be outlined in a post at a later date. 9.00%: Community Provisions Tokens distributed to those who contributed to Starknet and powered or developed its underlying technology. 9.00%: Community Rebates Tokens allocated for rebates in Starknet tokens to partially cover the costs of onboarding to Starknet from Ethereum. Community rebates are not yet available and will be announced in 2024 in a subsequent post. 10.00%: Foundation Strategic Reserves Tokens allocated for the Starknet Foundation to fund ecosystem activities that are aligned with the Foundation’s mission. 8.10%: Foundation Treasury Token allocated for the Starknet Foundation’s treasury available for operations and other future initiatives by the Starknet Foundation. 2.00%: Donations Tokens reserved for donations to institutions and organizations, such as universities, NGOs, etc, as decided by the Starknet Foundation. To align long-term incentives of the Investors and Early Contributors with the interests of the Starknet community, and following common practice in decentralized ecosystems, all tokens allocated to Investors and Early Contributors is subject to the following lock-up schedule, where percentages are based on the total token supply: Up to 0.64% (64 million tokens) will be unlocked on the 15th of each month, starting April 15, 2024, and going through March 15, 2025, for a total of 7.68% (768 million tokens) unlocked by March 15, 2025. Up to 1.27% (127 million tokens) will be unlocked on the 15th of each month, starting April 15, 2025, and going through March 15, 2027, for a total of 30.48% (3.048 billion tokens) unlocked by March 15, 2027. Figure 1. Estimated supply of STRK in circulation The graph, Estimated supply of STRK in circulation, excludes newly circulating tokens resulting from inflation or staking (see below). Token allotments currently retained by the Starknet Foundation, while contractually unlocked, are not considered circulating unless granted, donated, or otherwise allocated out of originating wallets through future grants, provisions, donations, developer initiatives, or other programs. Through this lock-up period, token holders cannot transfer, sell, or pledge their STRK tokens. Delegation of voting is permitted with locked tokens and, when available, staking might also be permitted. The total circulating supply of tokens is planned to increase over time with the minting of new tokens by the protocol, as staking rewards, block rewards, or other rewards associated with the staking process. Such minting will be made pursuant to a schedule that will be determined with the community at a later point, not before Starknet services are more decentralized. The supply in circulation might not, therefore, remain fixed. However, as long as StarkWare is the sole operator of the Starknet sequencer, there will be no issuance of new tokens for the purpose of block rewards. For more information, see A token-minting proposal to manage inflation. Starknet is a developing decentralized protocol and the economic mechanisms described herein are subject to change based on decisions made by the larger community of Starknet builders and users. Starknet relies upon third parties to adopt and implement software and protocols as users and contributors of Starknet. It also relies, in whole or partly, on third parties to develop, supply and otherwise support it. There is no assurance or guarantee that such third parties will continue to participate in the network or that the network will continue to function as intended. The technical documents provided herein describe certain planned and specified economic fundamentals of a digital asset, STRK. These materials are intended for informational purposes only and are meant to outline the usage and functionalities of the asset within Starknet. It is important to understand that the primary purpose of STRK is to pay for fees, provide a mechanism for securing consensus, and allow for decentralized governance on Starknet; it is not intended to serve as an investment. Starknet relies upon third parties to adopt and implement the software and protocols as users of Starknet. It also relies, in whole or partly, on third parties to develop, supply and otherwise support it. As a Layer 2 network over Ethereum, Starknet also relies upon third parties maintaining and operating the Ethereum network. There is no assurance or guarantee that those third parties will complete their work, properly carry out their obligations, and/or otherwise meet anyone’s needs. STRK, as the native token of Starknet, may be subject to the risks of the Starknet network, including, without limitation, the following: (i) the technology associated with Starknet may not function as intended; (ii) the details of the Starknet token economics including the total supply and distribution schedule may be changed due to decisions made by the consensus of participants of the Starknet network; (iii) Starknet may fail to attract sufficient interest from key stakeholders or users; (iv) Starknet may not progress satisfactorily and Starknet tokens may not be useful or valuable; (v) Starknet may suffer from attacks by hackers or other individuals; and (vi) Starknet is comprised of open-source technologies that depend on a network of computers to run certain software programs to process transactions, and because of this model StarkWare and the Starknet Foundation have limited control over Starknet. Risks related to blockchain technology in general and Starknet in particular may impact the usefulness of Starknet, and, in turn, the utility or value of STRK. The software and hardware, technology and technical concepts and theories applicable to Starknet and STRK are still in an early development stage and unproven, there is no warranty that Starknet will achieve any specific level of functionality or success, nor that the underlying technology will be uninterrupted or error-free, and there is an inherent risk that the technology could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, potentially, the complete loss of any Starknet tokens held by Starknet users. As with most commonly used public blockchains, STRK is accessed using a private key that corresponds to the address at which they are stored. If the private key, or the \"seed\" used to create the address and corresponding private key are lost or stolen, the tokens associated with that address might be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost. Public blockchain-based systems, including Starknet and the underlying Ethereum network, depend on independent verifiers, and therefore may be vulnerable to consensus attacks including, but not limited to, double-spend attacks, majority voting power attacks, race condition attacks, and censorship attacks. These attacks, if successful, could result in the permanent loss of STRK. Starknet, STRK, and blockchain technology are nascent, and there may be additional risks not described above or that may be new or unanticipated. We recommend only using Starknet or holding STRK if you are familiar with the technology and aware of the risks.

This topic explores the role and functionality of nodes in the Starknet ecosystem, their interactions with sequencers, and their overall importance. A node in the Starknet ecosystem is a computer equipped with Starknet software, contributing significantly to the network’s operation. Nodes are vital for the Starknet ecosystem’s functionality, security, and overall health. Without nodes, the Starknet network would not be able to function effectively. Nodes in Starknet are categorized into two types: Full nodes: Store the entire Starknet state and validate all transactions, crucial for the network’s integrity. Light nodes: Do not store the entire Starknet state but rely on full nodes for information. Light nodes are faster and more efficient but offer less security than full nodes. Nodes are fundamental to the Starknet network, performing a variety of critical functions: Transaction validation: Nodes ensure transactions comply with Starknet’s rules, helping prevent fraud and malicious activities. Block Creation and Propagation: Nodes create and circulate blocks to maintain a consistent blockchain view across the network. State maintenance: Nodes track the Starknet network’s current state, including user balances and smart contract code, essential for transaction processing and smart contract execution. API endpoint provision: Nodes provide API endpoints, aiding developers in creating applications, wallets, and tools for network interaction. Transaction relay: Nodes relay user transactions to other nodes, improving network performance and reducing congestion. Nodes and sequencers are interdependent: Nodes and block production: Nodes depend on sequencers to create blocks and update the network state. Sequencers integrate the transactions validated by nodes into blocks, maintaining a consistent and current Starknet state. Sequencers and transaction validation: Sequencers rely on nodes for transaction validation and network consensus. Prior to executing transactions, sequencers work with nodes to confirm transaction legitimacy, deterring fraudulent activities. Nodes also contribute to the consensus mechanism, ensuring uniformity in the blockchain state. The relationship between nodes and clients in the Starknet ecosystem is characterized by a client-server model: Client requests and node responses: Clients send requests, like transaction submissions or state queries. Nodes process these requests, validating transactions, updating the network state, and providing clients with the requested data. Client experience: Clients receive node responses, updating their local view with the latest network information. This loop enables user interaction with Starknet DApps, with nodes maintaining network integrity, while clients provide a user-friendly interface. The mempool acts as a holding area for unprocessed transactions: Transaction validation and mempool storage: Upon receiving a transaction, a node validates it. Valid transactions are added to the mempool and broadcast to other network nodes. Transaction selection and block inclusion: Nodes select transactions from the mempool for processing, incorporating them into blocks that are added to the blockchain. Each Starknet node implementation has its own strengths: Pathfinder, by Equilibrium: Pathfinder is a full node written in Rust. Pathfinder excels in high performance, scalability, and aligns with the Starknet Cairo specification. Juno, by Nethermind: Juno, is a full node written in Golang. Juno is known for user-friendliness, ease of deployment, and compatibility with Ethereum tools. Papyrus, by StarkWare: Papyrus is also a full node written in Rust. Papyrus focuses on security and robustness. It’s integral to the upcoming Starknet Sequencer, expected to boost network throughput. These implementations are continuously being improved, with new features and enhancements. The choice of implementation depends on user or developer preferences and requirements. Key characteristics of each node implementation are summarized below: Node Implementation Language Strengths Pathfinder Rust High performance, scalability, Cairo specification adherence Papyrus Rust Security, robustness, Starknet Sequencer foundation Juno Golang User-friendliness, ease of deployment, Ethereum compatibility","title":"Nodes","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"nodes","url":"/architecture-and-concepts/nodes/","titles":[{"text":"Overview of nodes in the Starknet ecosystem","hash":"overview-of-nodes-in-the-starknet-ecosystem","id":1},{"text":"Core functions of nodes","hash":"core-functions-of-nodes","id":2},{"text":"Interplay of nodes, sequencers, clients, and the mempool in Starknet","hash":"interplay-of-nodes-sequencers-clients-and-mempool-in-the-starknet-network","id":3},{"text":"Nodes and sequencers","hash":"nodes-and-sequencers","id":4},{"text":"Nodes and clients","hash":"nodes-and-clients","id":5},{"text":"Nodes and the mempool","hash":"nodes-and-the-mempool","id":6},{"text":"Node implementations in Starknet","hash":"node-implementations-in-starknet","id":7}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"This topic previously appeared in the Starknet Book. The only Prover in use on Starknet as of this writing is SHARP. SHARP is like public transportation for proofs on Starknet, aggregating multiple Cairo programs to save costs and boost efficiency. It uses recursive proofs, enabling parallelization and optimization, making it more affordable for all users. Critical services like the gateway, validator, and Prover work together with a stateless design for flexibility. SHARP’s adoption by StarkEx and Starknet highlights its significance and potential for future optimization. This topic discusses SHARP, how it has evolved to incorporate recursive proofs, and its role in reducing costs and improving efficiency within the Starknet network. SHARP, which stands for Shared Prover, is a mechanism that aggregates multiple Cairo programs from different users, each containing different logic. These Cairo programs are then executed together, generating a single proof common to all the programs. Rather than sending the proof directly to the Solidity Verifier in Ethereum, it is initially sent to a STARK Verifier program written in Cairo. The STARK Verifier generates a new proof to confirm that the initial proofs were verified, which can be sent back into SHARP and the STARK Verifier. Details for this recursive proof process appear below. Ultimately, the last proof in the series is sent to the Solidity Verifier on Ethereum. In other words, there are many proofs generated until we reach Ethereum and the Solidity Verifier. The primary benefit of SHARP lies in its ability to decrease costs and enhance efficiency within the Starknet network. It achieves this by aggregating multiple Cairo jobs, which are individual sets of computation. This aggregation enables the protocol to leverage the exponential amortization offered by STARK proofs. Exponential amortization means that as the computational load of the proofs increases, the cost of verifying those proofs rises at a slower logarithmic rate than the computation increase. As a result, the cost of each transaction within the aggregated set is significantly reduced, making the overall process more cost-effective and accessible for users. In the context of SHARP and Cairo context, a jobs refer to the individual Cairo programs or tasks submitted by different users. These jobs contain specific logic or computations that must be executed on the Starknet network. Additionally, SHARP enables smaller users with limited computation to benefit from joining other jobs and share the cost of generating the proofs. This collaborative approach is similar to using public transportation instead of a private car, where the cost is distributed among all participants, making it more affordable for everyone. One of the most powerful features of SHARP is its use of recursive proofs. Rather than directly sending the generated proofs to the Solidity Verifier, they are first sent to a STARK Verifier program written in Cairo. This Verifier, which is also a Cairo program, receives the proof and creates a new Cairo job that is sent to the Prover. The Prover then generates a new proof to confirm that the initial proofs were verified. These new proofs can be sent back into SHARP and the STARK Verifier, restarting the process. This process continues recursively, with each new proof being sent to the Cairo Verifier until a trigger is reached. At this point, the last proof in the series is sent to the Solidity Verifier on Ethereum. This approach enables greater parallelization of the computation and reduces the time and cost associated with generating and verifying proofs. Generated Proofs ￬ STARK Verifier program (in Cairo) ￬ Cairo Job ￬ Prover ￬ New Proof Generated ￬ Repeat Process ￬ Trigger Reached (last proof) ￬ Solidity Verifier At first glance, recursive proofs may seem more complex and time-consuming. However, there are several benefits to this approach: Parallelization: Recursive proofs enable work parallelization, reducing user latency and improving SHARP efficiency. Cheaper onchain costs: Parallelization enables SHARP to create larger proofs, which were previously dependent on the limited availability of large cloud machines. As a result, onchain costs are reduced. Lower cloud costs: Since each job is shorter, the required memory for processing is reduced, resulting in lower cloud costs. Optimization: Recursive proofs enable SHARP to optimize for various factors, including latency, onchain costs, and time to proof. Cairo support: Recursive proofs only require support in Cairo, without the need to add support in the Solidity Verifier. Latency in Starknet encompasses the time taken for processing, confirming, and including transactions in a block. Latency is affected by factors like network congestion, transaction fees, and system efficiency. Minimizing latency ensures faster transaction processing and user feedback. Time to proof, however, specifically pertains to the amount of time required to generate and verify cryptographic proofs for transactions or operations. SHARP’s backend architecture consists of several services that work together to process Cairo jobs and generate proofs. These services include: Gateway: Cairo jobs enter SHARP through the gateway. Job Creator: This service prevents job duplication and ensures that the system operates consistently, regardless of multiple identical requests. Validator: The validator service runs validation checks on each job, ensuring they meet the requirements and can fit within the Prover machines. Invalid jobs are tagged as such and do not proceed to the Prover. Scheduler: The scheduler service creates trains that aggregate jobs and send them to the Prover. Recursive jobs are paired and sent to the Prover together. Cairo Runner: This service runs Cairo for the Prover’s needs. The Cairo Runner service runs Cairo programs, executing the necessary computations and generating the execution trace as an intermediate result. The Prover then uses this execution trace. Prover: The Prover computes the proofs for each train. Dispatcher: The Dispatcher serves two functions in the SHARP system. In the case of a recursive proof, the Dispatcher runs the Cairo Verifier program on the proof it has received from the Prover, resulting in a new Cairo job that goes back to the Validator. In the case of a proof that is to be published onchain, the Dispatcher creates packages from the proof, which can then be sent to the Blockchain Writer. Blockchain Writer: Once the packages have been created by the Dispatcher, they are sent to the Blockchain Writer. The Blockchain Writer is responsible for sending the packages to the appropriate blockchain, such as Ethereum, for verification. This step in the SHARP system ensures that the proofs are properly verified and that the transactions are securely recorded on the blockchain. Catcher: The Catcher monitors onchain transactions to ensure that they have been accepted. While the Catcher is relevant for internal monitoring purposes, be aware that if a transaction fails, the fact won’t be registered onchain in the Fact Registry. As a result, the soundness of the system is still preserved even without the Catcher. SHARP is designed to be stateless. That is, each Cairo job is executed in its own context and has no dependency on other jobs, enabling greater flexibility in processing jobs. Currently, the primary users of SHARP include: StarkEx Starknet Optimizing the Prover involves the numerous challenges and potential projects on which the Starkware team and the community are currently working, including: Exploring more efficient hash functions for Cairo, the Prover, and Solidity. Investigating smaller fields for recursive proof steps could lead to more efficient computations. Adjusting various parameters of the STARK protocol, such as FRI parameters and block factors. Optimizing the Cairo code to make it faster, resulting in a faster recursive Prover. Developing dynamic layouts, which should enable Cairo programs to scale resources as needed. Improving scheduling algorithm. This optimization path is external to the Prover. Dynamic layouts enable SHARP to determine and scale the required resources for a specific job and adjust the layout accordingly, instead of relying on predefined layouts with fixed resources. Scaling resources can lead to more efficient computation and better resource utilization. This approach can provide tailored solutions for each job, improving overall efficiency. In conclusion, SHARP is a critical component of Starknet’s architecture, providing a more efficient and cost-effective solution for processing Cairo programs and verifying their proofs. By leveraging the power of STARK technology and incorporating recursive proofs, SHARP plays a vital role in improving the overall performance and scalability of the Starknet network. The stateless nature of SHARP and the reliance on the cryptographic soundness of the STARK proving system make it an innovative and valuable addition to the blockchain ecosystem.","title":"Provers","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"provers-overview","url":"/architecture-and-concepts/provers-overview/","titles":[{"text":"What is SHARP?","hash":"what-is-sharp","id":1},{"text":"Recursive proofs in SHARP","hash":"recursive-proofs-in-sharp","id":2},{"text":"SHARP backend architecture and data pipeline","hash":"sharp-backend-architecture-and-data-pipeline","id":3},{"text":"Current SHARP users","hash":"current-sharp-users","id":4},{"text":"Challenges and optimization","hash":"challenges-and-optimization","id":5},{"text":"Conclusion","hash":"conclusion","id":6}]},"8":{"id":8,"text":"This topic previously appeared in the Starknet Book. Starknet’s Solidity verifier ensures the truth of transactions and smart contracts. The Solidity verifier is an L1 Solidity smart contract, designed to validate STARK proofs from SHARP. The current Verifier is a set of multiple smart contracts, rather than being a singular, monolithic structure. Some key smart contracts associated with the Verifier are: GpsStatementVerifier: This is the primary contract of the SHARP verifier. It verifies a proof and then registers the related facts using verifyProofAndRegister. It acts as an umbrella for various layouts, each named CpuFrilessVerifier. Every layout has a unique combination of built-in resources. Figure 1. Verifier layouts The system routes each proof to its relevant layout. MemoryPageFactRegistry: This registry maintains facts for memory pages, primarily used to register outputs for data availability in rollup mode. The Fact Registry is a separate smart contract ensuring the verification and validity of attestations or facts. The verifier function is separated from the main contract to ensure each segment works optimally within its limits. The main proof segment relies on other parts, but these parts operate independently. MerkleStatementContract: This contract verifies Merkle paths. FriStatementContract: It focuses on verifying the FRI layers. The SHARP Verifier Contract Map contains roughly 40 contracts, detailing various components of the Solidity verifier. The images below display the contracts and their Ethereum Mainnet addresses.

It interacts with the GpsStatementVerifier contract using the delegate_call method. Notably, the state resides in the GpsStatementVerifier contract, not in the proxy. CallProxy: Positioned between the Proxy and the GpsStatementVerifier contracts, it functions like a typical proxy. However, it avoids the delegate_call method and calls the function in the implementation contract directly. CairoBootloaderProgram: Comprising numerical Cairo programs, it validates the Cairo program of a statement. The bootloader manages the logic executing Cairo programs to generate proof and program hash. PedersenHashPoints (X & Y Columns): These lookup tables store vast amounts of data. Validation functions consult them to compute the Pedersen hash. EcdsaPoints (X & Y Column): Similar to the Pedersen hash, these tables assist in calculating the elliptic curve. CpuFrilessVerifier/CpuOods/CpuConstantPoly (0 - 7): These Verifier contracts vary in layout as shown in the GpsStatementVerifier layout image. Each layout encompasses resources, built-ins, constraints, and more, designed for a specific task. Each has unique parameters for its constructor. PoseidonPoseidon: These contracts back the new Poseidon built-in and contain Poseidon-specific lookup tables. When constructing the primary Verifier contracts, specific parameters are employed to facilitate functionality. These parameters reference other auxiliary contracts, decentralizing the logic and ensuring the main contract remains under the 24kb deployment limit. Below is a visual representation of these parameters in relation to key contracts CpuFrilessVerifiers and GpsStatementVerifier: CpuFrilessVerifiers is designed to handle a diverse range of tasks. Its parameters encompass: Auxiliary Polynomial Contracts: These include CpuConstraintPoly, PedersenHashPointsxColumn, PedersenHashPointsYColumn, EcdsaPointsXColumn, and EcdsaPointsYColumn. Poseidon-Related Contracts: Several PoseidonPoseidonFullRoundKey and PoseidonPoseidonPartialRoundKey contracts. Sampling and Memory: The contract uses CpuOods for out-of-domain sampling and MemoryPageFactRegistry for memory-related tasks. Verification: It integrates with MerkleStatementContract for Merkle verification and FriStatementContract for Fri-related tasks. Security: The num_security_bits and min_proof_of_work_bits contracts ensure secure operation. For instances like CpuFrilessVerifier0, specific contracts (e.g., CpuConstraintPoly0, PoseidonPoseidonFullRoundKeyColumn0, CpuOods0) become particularly relevant. The GpsStatementVerifier functions as the hub of verifier operations, necessitating various parameters for effective functioning: Bootloader: It references the CairoBootloaderProgram to initiate the system. Memory Operations: This is facilitated by the MemoryPageFactRegistry contract. Sub-Verifiers: It integrates a series of sub-verifiers (CpuFrilessVerifier0 through CpuFrilessVerifier7) to decentralize tasks. Verification: The hashes, hashed_supported_cairo_verifiers and simple_bootloader_program_hash, are essential for validation processes. The GpsStatementVerifier serves as the primary verifier contract, optimized for minimal logic to fit within deployment size constraints. To function effectively: It relies on smaller verifier contracts, which are already deployed and contain varied verification logic. These smaller contracts, in turn, depend on other contracts, established during their construction. In essence, while the diverse functionalities reside in separate contracts for clarity and size efficiency, they are all interlinked within the GpsStatementVerifier. For future enhancements or adjustments, the proxy and callproxy contracts facilitate upgradability, allowing seamless updates to the GpsStatementVerifier without compromising its foundational logic. The SHARP dispatcher transmits all essential transactions for verification, including: MemoryPages (usually many). MerkleStatements (typically between 3 and 5). FriStatements (generally ranging from 5 to 15). The SHARP dispatcher then forwards the proof using verifyProofAndRegister. Applications, such as the Starknet monitor, validate the status. Once verification completes, they send an updateState transaction.","title":"Solidity verifier","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"solidity-verifier","url":"/architecture-and-concepts/solidity-verifier/","titles":[{"text":"Current architecture: Multiple smart contracts","hash":"current_architecture_multiple_smart_contracts","id":1},{"text":"SHARP Verifier contract map","hash":"sharp_verifier_contract_map","id":2},{"text":"Constructor parameters of key contracts","hash":"constructor_parameters_of_key_contracts","id":3},{"text":"CpuFrilessVerifier constructor parameters","hash":"cpufrilessverifier_constructor_parameters","id":4},{"text":"GpsStatementVerifier constructor parameters","hash":"gpsstatementverifier_constructor_parameters","id":5},{"text":"Interconnection of contracts","hash":"interconnection_of_contracts","id":6},{"text":"SHARP verification flow","hash":"sharp_verification_flow","id":7}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"The Starknet CLI is deprecated. Instead, use link: StarkLi CLI. To enter a Starknet command, use the following syntax: $ starknet Where: represents a single command that executes an operation on Starknet. represents zero or more command line options, each of which modifies the operation of the command. You need to set your Starknet network environment to use either testnet or Mainnet. You can set the environment using either a command-line option or an environment variable. Possible values are: sepolia Sets the Starknet network to testnet mainnet Sets the Starknet network to Mainnet Setting the network environment using a command-line option When you enter any command, include the --network option. For example to use Mainnet, enter a command as follows: $ starknet --network alpha-mainnet You can place the --network option before or after any other option. Setting the network environment using an environment variable Set the STARKNET_NETWORK environment variable as follows: $ export STARKNET_NETWORK= For example, to use testnet, enter the following command: $ export STARKNET_NETWORK=sepolia When working with the CLI, you can manually set the endpoints for the gateways that enable you to interact with Starknet, by including the following options: --feeder_gateway_url Sets the custom endpoint for read commands. --gateway_url Sets the custom endpoint for write commands.

Deploying a smart contract in Starknet requires two steps: Declaring the class of your contract, i.e. sending your contract’s code to the network. Deploying a contract, i.e. creating an instance of the code you previously declared. If you require a smart contract for testing, you can use this sample contract, lib.cairo, from the Starknet Book. You can compile a smart contract using the Scarb compiler. To compile a smart contract, create a directory containing a Scarb.toml file and a subdirectory named src containing your contract source code. Add the following code to the Scarb.toml file: [package] name = \"contracts\" version = \"0.1.0\" [dependencies] starknet = \">=2.2.0\" [[target.starknet-contract]] sierra = true Navigate into the newly created directory: cd Run the following command: scarb build The compiled contract will be saved in the target/dev/ directory. The contract is now compiled and ready to be deployed. Next you will need to declare an RPC provider within your contract. To interact with the Starknet network, you need to set an RPC endpoint within Starkli. The following are the RPC providers available for Starknet: Provider name Description Infura or Alchemy Use a provider like Infura or Alchemy. Custom configuration Set up your own node and use the RPC provider of your node. More information on this can be found within the Starknet Book. For demonstration purposes, the Starknet Sequencer’s Gateway is used in the below steps. A contract can be declared on Starknet using the following command: starkli declare target/dev/.json --network=sepolia --compiler-version=2.1.0 The --network flag is used to specify the network you want to use, it could also be mainnet for example. The --compiler-version flag is used to specify the version of the compiler you want to use. Starkli is currently running on version 2.6.x of the compiler. You can find the compiler version supported by Starkli by running: starkli declare --help In the --compiler-version flag you will see possible versions of the compiler: --compiler-version Statically-linked Sierra compiler version [possible values: 2.0.1, 2.1.0] However, the Scarb compiler version may be 2.2.0, you can find this out by running: scarb --version This is because Starkli and Scarb are not always in sync. In this case you would need to use the compiler version that Starkli is using by installing a previous version of Scarb. See the Scarb github repo for more detail. You can do this by running the following command for installing Scarb version 0.6.1: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh -s -- -v 0.6.1 If you were using a provider like Infura or Alchemy, the declaration command would look like this: starkli declare target/dev/contracts_Ownable.sierra.json \\ --rpc=https://starknet-sepolia.infura.io/v3/ \\ --compiler-version=2.6.0 The result of the declaration command is a contract class hash: Class hash declared: This hash is the identifier of the contract class in Starknet. You can think of it as the address of the contract class. You can use a block explorer like StarkScan to see the contract class hash in the blockchain. If the contract you are declaring has previously been declared by someone else, you will get an output like this: Not declaring class as its already declared.

For our example, the constructor expects an address to assign as the owner: starkli deploy \\ \\ \\ --network=sepolia With the class hash and constructor inputs, the command looks like this: starkli deploy \\ 0x00e68b4b07aeecc72f768b1c086d9b0aadce131a40a1067ffb92d0b480cf325d \\ 0x02cdAb749380950e7a7c0deFf5ea8eDD716fEb3a2952aDd4E5659655077B8510 \\ --network=sepolia After running the command and adding your password, you will see an output similar to this: Deploying class 0x00e68b4b07aeecc72f768b1c086d9b0aadce131a40a1067ffb92d0b480cf325d with salt 0x04bc3fc2284c8e41fb3d2a37bb0354fd0506131cc77a8c91e4e67ce3aed1d19e...

To compile, deploy, and interact with our smart contract, use the Starknet Remix plugin. This tool enables you to start to develop for Starknet without the need for any local installations on your machine. Go to the Remix IDE website with the Starknet plugin activated. Click the File Explorer tab to review the details of the example project. Click the Starknet tab, and click the Settings. Select the latest version of Cairo available in Remix. In the File explorer, open the Scarb.toml file to verify the version of your project. Ensure it matches the version specified originally, and correct any discrepancies, if necessary. For this tutorial, a default example project is provided. Modify or remove certain files and directories as needed. Rename the root directory to ownable. In your Scarb.toml, under the [package] section, set the name to ownable. Under src/, delete the balance.cairo and forty_two.cairo files, if they exist. Open lib.cairo and delete all its contents. Explore the Example Ownable contract, crafted in Cairo for Starknet. It includes: An ownership system. A method to transfer ownership. A method to check the current owner. An event notification for ownership changes. use starknet::ContractAddress; (1) #[starknet::interface] trait OwnableTrait { (1) fn transfer_ownership(ref self: T, new_owner: ContractAddress); (2) fn get_owner(self: @T) -> ContractAddress; (2) } #[starknet::contract] mod Ownable { use super::ContractAddress; use starknet::get_caller_address; #[event] #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] enum Event { OwnershipTransferred: OwnershipTransferred, (3) } #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] struct OwnershipTransferred { (3) #[key] prev_owner: ContractAddress, #[key] new_owner: ContractAddress, } #[storage] struct Storage { (4) owner: ContractAddress, } #[constructor] fn constructor(ref self: ContractState, init_owner: ContractAddress) { (5) self.owner.write(init_owner); } #[abi(embed_v0)] impl OwnableImpl of super::OwnableTrait { fn transfer_ownership(ref self: ContractState, new_owner: ContractAddress) { self.only_owner(); let prev_owner = self.owner.read(); self.owner.write(new_owner); self.emit(Event::OwnershipTransferred(OwnershipTransferred { prev_owner: prev_owner, new_owner: new_owner, })); } fn get_owner(self: @ContractState) -> ContractAddress { self.owner.read() } } #[generate_trait] impl PrivateMethods of PrivateMethodsTrait { fn only_owner(self: @ContractState) { (6) let caller = get_caller_address(); assert(caller == self.owner.read(), 'Caller is not the owner'); } } } 1 Dependencies and Interface: starknet::ContractAddress: Represents a Starknet contract address. OwnableTrait: Defines essential functions for transferring and retrieving ownership. 2 External Functions: Contains functions for transferring ownership and fetching information about the current owner. 3 Events: OwnershipTransferred indicates changes in ownership, providing details about the previous and new owners. 4 Storage: Stores the contract’s state, including the address of the current owner. 5 Constructor: Sets up the contract by assigning an initial owner. 6 Private Methods: only_owner validates if the caller is the current owner. To compile using Remix: Click the File Explorer tab, open the lib.cairo file and insert the code from Example: ownable Cairo contract. Click the Starknet tab, then click Home. Under (1) Compile, click Compile lib.cairo. Grant the necessary permissions when prompted. Select Remember my choice for a smoother compilation process in the future. The compilation process creates an artifacts directory containing the compiled contract in two formats: a Sierra file, in JSON format, and a Casm file. For Starknet deployment, Remix uses the Sierra file. Deploying a smart contract in Starknet requires two high-level steps: Declare the class of your contract, that is, send your contract’s code to the network. When you declare the contract class, you establish an initial owner by calling the class’s constructor function. Deploy an instance of the contract class. This tutorial uses a development network (devnet) to deploy your smart contract. A devnet is a Starknet instance that you run as a local node. A devnet enables much quicker development than is possible using testnet, as well as providing privacy prior to launching on testnet. Declaring the contract class Select the network by clicking the Starknet tab, and then clicking the Remote Devnet menu. Under Devnet account selection, open the menu to view a list of accounts specific to the designated devnet. Select a devnet account from the list and note its address for later use. Click the Declare lib.cairo button. Remix’s terminal provides various logs with important details such as: transaction_hash: This unique hash identifies the transaction and can be used to track its status. class_hash: Similar to an identifier, the class hash contains the definition of the smart contract. Remix terminal output after declaring the ownable contract ------------------------ Declaring contract: lib.cairo ------------------------ { \"transaction_hash\": \"0x36dabf43f4962c97cf67ba132fb520091f268e7e33477d77d01747eeb0d7b43\", \"class_hash\": \"0x540779cd109ad20f46cb36d8de1ce30c75469862b4dc75f2f29d1b4d1454f60\" } ---------------------- End Declaring contract: lib.cairo ---------------------- After Remix declares the contract class, the Declare button says Declared lib.cairo. Now you’re ready to deploy an instance of the contract class. Deploying a contract instance Paste the Devnet account address you used into the init_owner variable. Click Deploy. After deployment, Remix’s terminal displays various logs, including a transaction receipt, containing important details, such as: transaction_hash: This unique hash identifies the transaction and can be used to track its status. contract_address: The address of the deployed contract. You can use this address to interact with your contract. data: Contains the init_owner address provided to the constructor. Remix terminal output after deploying an instance of the Ownable class in lib.cairo ------------------------ Deploying contract: lib.cairo ------------------------ { \"transaction_hash\": \"0x624f5b9f57e53f6b5b62e588f0f949442172b3ad5d04f0827928b4d12c2fa58\", \"contract_address\": [ \"0x699952dc736661d0ed573cd2b0956c80a1602169e034fdaa3515bfbc36d6410\" ] ... \"data\": [ \"0x6b0ee6f418e47408cf56c6f98261c1c5693276943be12db9597b933d363df\", ... ] ... } ---------------------- End Deploying contract: lib.cairo ---------------------- Now that the contract is operational on the development network, you can start interacting with it on the Starknet tab, under (3) Interact. Under Read you should see the get_owner() function. Click the Call button. The function doesn’t require any arguments so the calldata field remains empty. This function reads data, so its invocation is referred to as a call. The terminal displays the output, showing the owner’s address, which you provided during the contract’s deployment within the calldata for the constructor: ------------------- Calling get_owner ------------------------ { \"resp\": { \"result\": [ \"0x6b0ee6f418e47408cf56c6f98261c1c5693276943be12db9597b933d363df\" ] }, \"contract\": \"lib.cairo\", \"function\": \"get_owner\" } ------------------- End calling get_owner -------------------- This call doesn’t consume gas because the function doesn’t modify the contract’s state. Under (3) Interact, select Write, where functions that alter the contract’s state are listed. Select the transfer_ownership() function, which requires providing the new owner address as input. Fill in the new_owner field with any Devnet address other than the one you used to deploy the contract. Under Devnet account selection, open the menu, select a Devnet account from the list, and copy its address. Click the Call button. The terminal displays the transaction hash indicating the change in the contract’s state. Because this interaction is an INVOKE transaction, and it modifies the contract’s state. An INVOKE transaction requires the signature of the account executing the function. For INVOKE transactions, the terminal logs include a finality_status parameter indicating the outcome. A status of ACCEPTED_ON_L2 indicates approval by the Sequencer, the entity responsible for receiving and processing transactions, indicating inclusion in an upcoming block. Conversely, a REJECTED status indicates that the Sequencer did not approve the transaction, preventing its inclusion in the next block. Typically, transactions of this nature are approved, resulting in a modification of the contract’s state. ---------- Invoke transfer_ownership transaction receipt ---------------- { \"resp\": { \"transaction_hash\": \"0x5495d56633745aa3b97bdb89c255d522e98fd2cb481974efe898560839aa472\" }, \"contract\": \"lib.cairo\", \"function\": \"get_owner\" } ----------End Invoke transfer_ownership transaction receipt ------------- After testing your smart contract on a development network, the next step is deploying it onto the Starknet testnet. The Starknet testnet is a public platform accessible to all, providing an excellent environment for testing smart contracts and encouraging collaboration among developers. Before deploying your smart contract on Starknet, it’s crucial to address transaction costs. While deploying on the Starknet testnet is free, having an operational smart wallet account is essential. You can set up a smart wallet and a Starknet account using either of the following platforms: Argent Braavos Both options offer robust Starknet wallets with advanced security measures and enhanced accessibility features enabled by the capabilities of the Cairo VM. Here’s how to set up your smart wallet: Install the recommended browser extension corresponding to your chosen wallet. Follow the instructions provided by your wallet provider to deploy your account on testnet. Use the Starknet Faucet to fund your account. Execute the deployment of your account onto the network, typically completed within approximately 10 seconds. Once the setup is complete, you are primed to deploy your smart contracts onto the Starknet testnet. Proceed as per the aforementioned deployment steps. Within the Environment selection tab, Select Wallet. Select your Starknet account and proceed with the deployment and interaction processes for your contract. You can monitor transaction hashes and addresses by using various Starknet block explorers such as: Starkscan Voyager ViewBlock Oklink These block explorers offer a graphical depiction of transactions and modifications to the contract state. Noteworthy is the visibility provided when altering contract ownership through the transfer_ownership() function, as the emitted event by the contract becomes observable within the block explorer. This mechanism serves as a potent means to monitor contractual events.","title":"Deploying and interacting with a Starknet smart contract with Remix","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"deploy-interact-with-a-smart-contract-remix","url":"/quick-start/deploy-interact-with-a-smart-contract-remix/","titles":[{"text":"Setting up your environment in Remix","hash":"setting_up_your_environment_in_remix","id":1},{"text":"Customizing your environment for the Ownable contract","hash":"customizing_your_environment_for_the_ownable_contract","id":2},{"text":"Exploring the ownable Starknet smart contract","hash":"exploring_the_ownable_starknet_smart_contract","id":3},{"text":"Example: ownable Cairo contract","hash":"example-cairo-contract","id":4},{"text":"Contract component breakdown","hash":"contract_component_breakdown","id":5},{"text":"Compiling the contract","hash":"compiling_the_contract","id":6},{"text":"Deploying your contract on the development network (devnet)","hash":"deploying_your_contract_on_the_development_network_devnet","id":7},{"text":"Interacting with the contract","hash":"interacting_with_the_contract","id":8},{"text":"Identifying the owner of the contract instance","hash":"identifying_the_owner_of_the_contract_instance","id":9},{"text":"Transferring ownership of the contract instance","hash":"transferring_ownership_of_the_contract_instance","id":10},{"text":"Deployment on Starknet testnet","hash":"deployment_on_starknet_testnet","id":11},{"text":"Setting up a smart wallet and a Starknet account on testnet","hash":"setting_up_a_smart_wallet_and_a_starknet_account_on_testnet","id":12},{"text":"Deployment and Interaction","hash":"deployment_and_interaction","id":13}]},"14":{"id":14,"text":"In order to use Starknet, you need to install several tools. This section will walk you through installing the three most recommended tools to begin developing on Starknet: Starkli, a command-line interface that allows you to interact with Starknet. Scarb, a build toolchain and package manager for Cairo and Starknet ecosystems. Starknet Foundry, the go-to framework for building and testing Starknet Smart Contracts To review all Starknet developer tools, check out the tools and resources section. It is highly recommended to install Starkli on MacOS and Linux using the starkliup portable script. starkliup manages shell configuration for you, and using any other installation method requires to manually set up shell completions. Procedure Download starkliup: curl https://get.starkli.sh | sh Restart the terminal and install Starkli: starkliup Restart the terminal and verify that Starkli is installated correctly: starkli --version Starknet Foundry’s installation on Windows requires manually setting up shell completions. Procedure Install Starkli: cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/xJonathanLEI/starkli Restart the terminal and verify that Starkli is installated correctly: starkli --version Set up Starkli’s shell completions by following the instructions in the Starkli documentation. For the majority of flags available on Starkli you can set environment variables to make the commands shorter and easier to manage. Setting environment variables for Starkli significantly simplifies command execution and management, thereby enhancing efficiency, readability, and control when using Starkli. The two primary environment variables that are vital for effective usage of Starkli’s CLI are: STARKNET_ACCOUNT The location of the Account Descriptor file. STARKNET_KEYSTORE The location of the keystore file for the Signer. Set these environment variables as follows: export STARKNET_ACCOUNT=~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json export STARKNET_KEYSTORE=~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json It is highly recommended to install Scarb on MacOS and Linux via the asdf version manager. Installing Scarb with asdf seamlessly integrates with the Cairo Cairo VSCode extension, and allows to easily switch between different versions of Scarb, both globally and per project (see full details in the asdf documentation or by running asdf --help). Procedure Verify that asdf is installed: asdf --version or install it by following the instructions in the asdf documentation. Install the asdf Scarb plugin: asdf plugin add scarb Install the latest version of Scarb: asdf install scarb latest Verify that Scarb is installed correctly: scarb --version Scarb’s installation on Windows requires manual setup.

Starkli enables interaction with smart contracts via two primary methods: call for read-only functions. invoke for write functions that modify the state. The call command allows querying a smart contract function without sending a transaction. As an example you can use the get_owner function which doesn’t expect any arguments and returns the address of the current owner: starkli call \\ 0x014825acb37c36563d3b96c450afe363d2fdfa3cfbd618b323f95b68b55ebf7e \\ get_owner --network=sepolia This will return the address that we passed to the constructor during deployment: [ \"0x02cdab749380950e7a7c0deff5ea8edd716feb3a2952add4e5659655077b8510\" ] To modify the state of the smart contract, use the invoke command. Unlike the call command, invoke submits a transaction to the network. In this example, we’ll invoke the transfer_ownership function to transfer the ownership from our deployer address to a different smart wallet address: starkli invoke \\ 0x014825acb37c36563d3b96c450afe363d2fdfa3cfbd618b323f95b68b55ebf7e \\ transfer_ownership \\ 0x011088d3cbe4289bc6750ee3a9cf35e52f4fa4e0ac9f42fb0b62e983139e135a \\ --network=sepolia After the transaction is accepted on L2, you can confirm the state transition by calling the get_owner function again: starkli call \\ 0x014825acb37c36563d3b96c450afe363d2fdfa3cfbd618b323f95b68b55ebf7e \\ get_owner \\ --network=sepolia The get_owner function now returns the new owner address, confirming the successful ownership transfer.","title":"Interacting with a smart contract","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"interact-with-a-smart-contract","url":"/quick-start/interact-with-a-smart-contract/","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Ensure Starkli and Scarb are installed correctly","hash":"ensure_starkli_and_scarb_are_installed_correctly","id":2},{"text":"Introduction","hash":"introduction","id":3},{"text":"Calling a function","hash":"calling_a_function","id":4},{"text":"Invoking a function","hash":"invoking_a_function","id":5}]},"16":{"id":16,"text":"This guide shows you how to set up a Starknet account and wallet in the context of a smart contract deployment. For information on creating a Starknet wallet as an end user, see Getting Started Using Starknet: Setting Up a Starknet Wallet. Starkli is installed correctly. Ensure that the following command shows the version information for Starkli: starkli --version If this command fails, see Setting up your environment. A Starknet wallet is installed, either Argent X or Braavos. For information on a specific wallet, including installation instructions, see that wallet’s site. A smart wallet is composed of two parts: A Signer: A smart contract that can sign transactions. An Account Descriptor: A json file that contains information about the smart wallet, such as its address and public key. After creating and funding your smart wallet with ETH you can deploy it to Starknet. For demonstration purposes, this page uses Starknet’s testnet. For testnet transactions you can fund your wallet using one of the Starknet Sepolia faucets. A Signer is a smart contract that can sign transactions. It’s a crucial component of accounts in Starknet. To create a Signer you will need the private key of your smart wallet (the public key can be derived from it). Starkli has the ability to create a keystore file that securely stores the private key of smart wallets each with a password. The accounts in the keystore file can be used to sign transactions using Starkli. The main advantage of this approach is that it prevents storing the private key as plain text on your computer. Instead, a password is used to create an encrypted file in a location of choice. Normally, the keystore file is stored in the default location of the Starkli CLI. The following command creates a keystore file for a smart wallet in the default location in ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer: Create a new directory: mkdir -p ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer Create a keystore file within the directory: starkli signer keystore from-key ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json Enter private key: Enter password: Created new encrypted keystore file: /home/parallels/.starkli-wallets/deployer/keystore.json Public key: 0x0550… In the private key prompt, paste the private key of your smart wallet. In the password prompt, enter a password of your choice. You will need this password to sign transactions using Starkli. Next export the private key from your Argent X or Braavos wallet: Navigate to: Settings section → Select your Account → Export Private Key. Navigate to: Settings section → Privacy and Security → Export Private Key. While knowing the private key of a smart wallet is necessary to sign transactions, it’s not sufficient. We also need to inform Starkli about the signing mechanism employed by our smart wallet created by Argent X or Braavos. Starkli offers a command to collect all the required information from a smart wallet by providing its onchain address. Using this data, the CLI generates a json file that can be used to sign transactions: starkli account fetch --help Fetch account config from an already deployed account contract The fetch command supports both Argent X and Braavos smart wallets. Make sure your wallet address is already deployed and enter the following command to create and save the account descriptor file: starkli account fetch --output ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json --rpc You can obtain access to a JSON-RPC endpoint in one of the following ways: Host your own node with Pathfinder, Juno, Deoxys, or Papyrus. Use a third-party JSON-RPC API provider. For information on providers, see Full nodes and API services. The following command shows the details of the account descriptor: cat ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json The account descriptor should have the following structure: { \"version\": 1, \"variant\": { \"type\": \"argent\", \"version\": 1, \"implementation\": \"\", \"signer\": \"\", \"guardian\": \"0x0\" }, \"deployment\": { \"status\": \"deployed\", \"class_hash\": \"\", \"address\": \"\" } } If you are working with Braavos wallet, the type is defined as braavos and the account descriptor structure might be slightly different. Once you have an account file, you can deploy the account contract with the starkli account deploy command. This command sends a DEPLOY_ACCOUNT transaction, which requires the account to contain enough ETH to pay for the transaction fee. To deploy your account, run the following command: starkli account deploy ~/.starkli-wallets/deployer/account.json This command requires a signer. If you receive an error after running this command, ensure you have the STARKNET_KEYSTORE environment variable set as per these instructions. When run, the command shows: The address where the contract will be deployed. Instructions for the user to fund the account before proceeding. Here’s an example command output: The estimated account deployment fee is 0.000011483579723913 ETH. However, to avoid failure, fund at least: 0.000017225369585869 ETH to the following address: 0x01cf4d57ba01109f018dec3ea079a38fc08b789e03de4df937ddb9e8a0ff853a Press [ENTER] once youve funded the address.

The architecture is modular, with different contracts handling specific responsibilities to ensure flexibility, security, and ease of upgrades. For more details on the staking architecture, visit the following link: Starknet Staking Repository. Staking is divided into several key components, each responsible for different aspects of the staking process. Table 1. Contracts of the Staking Architecture Contract Description Staking Contract The central contract that manages the staking process, which handles direct staking, rewards distribution, and interactions with delegation pools. Validators interact with this contract to stake their tokens, claim rewards, and initiate unstaking. Delegation Pooling Contract This contract manages the delegation process, allowing delegators to assign their tokens to a validator for staking. The contract is responsible for tracking each delegator’s share, calculating their rewards, and managing the delegation and unstaking processes. Reward Supplier Contract A dedicated contract that calculates and supplies the rewards for validators and delegators. It interfaces with the staking contract to distribute rewards based on the defined minting curve. Minting Curve Contract A contract responsible for implementing the minting curve logic that governs the reward distribution mechanism. It adjusts rewards dynamically based on the total staked amount and the overall supply of STRK tokens. The following data structures are stored within the contracts and play a crucial role in managing validators' and delegators' information within the staking protocol: Table 2. Key Structures in the Staking Architecture Structure Description StakerInfo Structure A data structure stored within the staking contract that holds detailed information about each validator, including their staked amount, unclaimed rewards, delegation details, and operational parameters. This structure ensures that validators' information is accurately tracked and updated. PoolMemberInfo Structure A data structure stored within the delegation pooling contract that holds information about each delegator’s contributions, rewards, and status within the pool. This structure helps manage and calculate the delegation and reward distribution processes for pool members. For more technical details, you can refer to the full staking specification document available in: Staking Repository Spec. The staking contract is the core of the staking system. It manages the entire lifecycle of staking, from initial staking to claiming rewards and unstaking. *Key Functions and Responsibilities *: stake: Allows users to stake their STRK tokens. increase_stake: Lets existing validators increase their stake. unstake_intent: Initiates the unstaking process, which can be finalized using unstake_action if sufficient time has passed. unstake_action: Finalizes the unstaking process after the waiting period, returning tokens to the validator address. claim_rewards: Allows users to claim rewards. The delegation pooling contract enables users to delegate their tokens. All interactions, such as entering or exiting the pool, are enabled through this contracts, which tracks each delegator’s contribution, calculates their rewards, and manages the delegation lifecycle. Key Functions and Responsibilities: enter_delegation_pool: Allows users to delegate their tokens to the pool associated with a validator. This function transfers the tokens, updates the delegator’s record, and integrates them into the validator’s pool. add_to_delegation_pool: Enables existing delegators to increase their delegation amount. The contract updates the pool’s total and recalculates the member’s rewards. exit_delegation_pool_intent: Initiates the process for a delegator to exit the pool. Similar to validators, the delegator’s funds are locked for a period before they can be withdrawn. exit_delegation_pool_action: Finalizes the exit process for a delegator, returning their tokens and any unclaimed rewards. switch_delegation_pool: Allows a delegator to transfer their delegated stake from one validator’s pool to another, facilitating dynamic delegation strategies. claim_rewards: Transfers the delegator’s earned rewards to their specified reward address. The reward supplier contract is responsible for calculating and supplying the staking rewards based on the minting curve. It ensures that the rewards are distributed fairly and in accordance with the protocol’s economic parameters. Key Functions and Responsibilities: calculate_staking_rewards: Computes the rewards based on the current staking rate and the minting curve, updating the staking contract with the amount to be distributed. claim_rewards: Handles the transfer of rewards to the staking contract, ensuring that the correct amount is distributed to validators and delegators. The minting curve contract defines the economic model that governs reward distribution. It ensures that the network’s inflation is managed while incentivizing participation in staking. Key Functions and Responsibilities: yearly_mint: Returns the amount of STRK tokens to be minted annually based on the current staking rate. This function uses a square root formula to balance rewards and inflation. update_total_supply: Updates the total supply of STRK tokens, ensuring that the minting calculations remain accurate. The staking architecture on Starknet is designed with security and upgradability in mind. Each contract is modular, allowing for targeted upgrades and improvements without affecting the entire system. Access control mechanisms are in place to ensure that only authorized parties can make critical changes, further enhancing the security of the staking process.","title":"Staking Architecture","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"architecture","url":"/staking/architecture/","titles":[{"text":"Components of the Staking Architecture","hash":"components_of_the_staking_architecture","id":1},{"text":"Staking Contract","hash":"staking_contract","id":2},{"text":"Delegation Pooling Contract","hash":"delegation_pooling_contract","id":3},{"text":"Reward Supplier Contract","hash":"reward_supplier_contract","id":4},{"text":"Minting Curve Contract","hash":"minting_curve_contract","id":5},{"text":"Security and Upgradability","hash":"security_and_upgradability","id":6}]},"19":{"id":19,"text":"Staking rewards on Starknet accumulate over time as your staked STRK tokens contribute to network security.

Stake: Locking STRK tokens into the staking protocol. Delegate: Assigning STRK tokens to a validator to participate indirectly. Reward: Earnings from participating in staking. Staking on starknet.io (coming soon) starknet-staking GitHub repository Staking dashboards: Karnot Staking Rewards Voyager In the future, validators will be responsible for maintaining and securing the network by producing, attesting, and proving blocks, as part of Starknet’s consensus protocol. However, handing over these responsibilities all in one day is neither feasible nor desirable. Instead, the first stage of staking on Starknet will only require validators to run full nodes and test the protocol’s economic incentive structure and some of its key smart contract components. In the first phase of staking on Starknet, validators are required to run a full node in preparation for future staking phases Over time, validators' responsibilities will gradually increase, with each phase bringing additional tasks until validators fully maintain and secure the network. This incremental approach is necessary, as it allows for the following: Gradual implementation: introducing features in small and manageable milestones, ensuring each step is carefully implemented and easily integrated, and allowing to refine the process and address issues as they arise Validators preparation: giving validators time to adapt to their new responsibilities and critical roles, maximizing the network’s stability during the transition Proven reliability: having a proven set of sequencers that reliably produce and attest to blocks by the time validators perform their full responsibilities, cementifying the network’s decentralization The staking protocol features two main options: Staking: Users can stake any amount of STRK, with a minimum threshold set at 20,000 STRK. Validators are expected to run full nodes and eventually handle additional responsibilities as the protocol evolves. Validators can choose whether to allow delegation. Stake Delegation: Users can delegate their STRK to validators without running their own nodes, if the validator allows delegation. Delegators share in the rewards earned by the validators they choose. Validators and delegators can both unstake their funds, subject to network-defined latencies for security. The minting curve balances participation and inflation by adjusting rewards based on the total STRK locked in the protocol. It is defined by the formula: \\[M = \\frac{C}{10} \\times \\sqrt{S}\\] where: \\(S\\) is the staking rate as a percentage of the total token supply \\(M\\) is the annual minting rate as a percentage of the total token supply \\(C\\) is the maximum theoretical inflation percentage For the first stage, \\(C\\) is proposed to be 1.6%. Rewards are distributed based on the amount staked and the commission policy constant \\(CP\\) set by the validator. The yearly reward percentages are calculated using the following formulas: \\[\\begin{align} \\text{Validators: } & \\; \\left[\\text{self_stake} + \\text{total_stake_delegated} \\times CP\\right] \\times \\frac{M}{S} \\\\ \\text{Stake Delegators: } & \\; \\text{stake_delegated} \\times (1 - CP) \\times \\frac{M}{S} \\end{align}\\] where \\(M\\) and \\(S\\) are the same as described in the minting curve section. Current version: Immediate entry and exit from the staking protocol. However, funds are subject to a 21-day security lockup after signaling unstake intent. Future versions: Introduction of epochs to determine entry/exit latencies and continued 21-day lockup after signaling unstake intent. Stake delegators can switch between validators without waiting for the full lockup period, promoting a competitive delegation market.

By default, StarkGate imposes no limit on withdrawals. However, in order to mitigate risks associated with critical vulnerabilities that could result in the loss of user funds, StarkGate can enable a withdrawal limit. If a serious security issue arises, the security agent in the StarkGate contract can limit withdrawals to 5% of the Total Value Locked (TVL) per day for any affected token by calling the setWithdrawLimitPCT() function in the WithdrawalLimit.sol contract. A dedicated team can then investigate and resolve the issue. Only a security admin quorum can disable the withdrawal limit. The quorum will consist of Starknet Foundation members, Starknet ecosystem contributors, and StarkWare representatives. This diverse group will ensure that decisions reflect the Starknet community’s broad interests. This approach, blending manual oversight with automated detection, aims to minimize potential losses.

Each supported token is associated with an L1 and L2 bridge contract that communicates via Starknet’s messaging mechanism. To use the StarkGate web app, go to https://starkgate.starknet.io. A bridge enables you to fund your L2 wallet with ETH and ERC-20 tokens that reside on L1. The terms deposit, transact, and transfer refer to various operations involving a bridge, even though ETH and ERC-20 tokens never actually leave Ethereum. StarkGate 2.0 provides a contract that enables seamless backward compatibility with the previous version of StarkGate. When you update the code in your contract, make sure that you use the most up-to-date versions of all StarkGate contracts. L1 and L2 addresses for StarkGate bridges and supported tokens are listed in the JSON files shown in the table StarkGate bridged tokens and their addresses. Table 1. StarkGate bridged tokens and their addresses Network StarkGate bridged tokens JSON file Mainnet tokens.json Sepolia tokens.json StarkGate supports many tokens, including ETH, WBTC, USDC, DAI, and many more. For a comprehensive list of tokens that StarkGate supports, including their L1 and L2 addresses, see the JSON files shown in the table StarkGate bridged tokens and their addresses. Previously, StarkGate placed limitations for each supported token on the amount that could be deposited and the total value locked in the L1 bridge contract on Mainnet. These limits have been removed. A call to the L1 deposit function initiates a deposit. The function does the following: Transfers the funds from the user’s account to the Starknet bridge. Emits a Deposit event that includes the L1 and L2 addresses of the user, and the amount deposited. Sends a message to the corresponding L2 bridge with the amount deposited, and the recipient’s address. Starknet’s sequencer is now aware of the deposit transaction. The sequencer waits for enough L1 block confirmations to fill its quota to run before the corresponding deposit transaction is initiated on L2. During this period of time, the status of the L2 deposit transaction is NOT_RECEIVED. The sequencers refer to the deposit request by triggering the L1 handler using the handle_deposit function on the L2 bridge. The handle_deposit function verifies that the deposit indeed came from the corresponding L1 bridge. It then calls the relevant token’s contract on Starknet and mints the specified amount of the token on L2 for the user. The sequencers complete constructing the block. The status of the deposit request is now ACCEPTED_ON_L2. Starknet’s provers prove the validity of the block and submit a state update to L1. The message confirming transfer of the funds is cleared from the Starknet Core Contract, and the fact that the user has transferred their funds is part of the now finalized state of Starknet. If the message wasn’t on L1 to begin with, that is, if the deposit request was fraudulently created on Starknet, the state update fails. A call to the L2 initiate_token_withdraw function initiates a withdrawal. The function does the following: Burns the transferred amount of tokens from the balance of the withdrawal’s initiator. Sends a message to the relevant L1 bridge with the amount to be transferred and the recipient’s address. The sequencer completes the block construction Starknet’s provers prove the validity of the block and submit a state update to L1. The message from the previous step is stored in the Starknet Core Contract. After the withdrawal message has been recorded on the Starknet Core Contract, anyone can finalize the transfer on L1 from the bridge back to the user, by calling the withdraw function. This step is permissionless, anyone can do it. The recipient’s address is part of the recorded message on L1, so they receive the funds regardless of who calls the withdraw function on L1.

To view the token addresses for tokens on Mainnet or Sepolia testnet, see Bridged tokens and addresses. Procedure Using a Starknet block explorer, go to the StarkGate contract for the token you want to withdraw. For example, to withdraw USDC: If using Voyager, go to the USDC StarkGate bridge and click Write Contract. If using StarkScan, go to the USDC StarkGate bridge and click Read/Write Contract Write. Click the initiate_token_withdraw function and enter the following: In l1_token, enter the L1 address of the ERC-20 contract for the token you want to withdraw, in this case, USDC. In l1_recipient, enter the L1 address of the recipient. In amount, enter the amount to transfer. Click Transact for Voyager, or Write for StarkScan. The function initiates a withdrawal.

Since this release is required for v0.11.1, you should update your node before the network is updated. Starknet v0.11.1 support CORS support via the rpc.cors-domains configuration option Transaction hashes are now verified as part of the sync process. Previously, these were not verified as the exact algorithm was underdocumented and the transaction format was still evolving. RPC server panic for unprefixed unregistered method names Data can temporarily appear to go missing when transitioning from PENDING to ACCEPTED ON L2 This was commonly seen when rapidly monitoring a new transaction, which would go from PENDING to TXN_HASH_NOT_FOUND to ACCEPTED_ON_L2 as pathfinder moved the ephemeral pending data to latest data on disk. Fixes for minor issues and inconsistencies. max-rpc-connections command-line argument. This sets the maximum number incoming RPC connections the pathfinder node will accept. This defaults to 1024 if not specified. cairo-lang upgraded to 0.11.0.2 starknet_simulateTransaction data model inconsistency poll-pending default value restored to false incoming RPC connections limited to 100. This limit was accidentally introduced in v0.5.2 as part of a dependency upgrade, whereas before it was unlimited. The default is now 1024 and can be configured using --max-rpc-connections. handling of invalid JSON-RPC requests This release fixes a few RPC bugs and adds support for bulk fee estimation and transaction simulation (traces) as part of v0.3 RPC specification. In addition it also adds a pathfinder_getTransactionStatus endpoint which lets you track a transactions status — including REJECTED and RECEIVED — in the same fashion as the gateway. support starknet_estimateFee in the JSON-RPC v0.3 API supports estimating multiple transactions this includes declaring and immediately using a class (not currently possible via the gateway) support starknet_simulateTransaction for JSON-RPC v0.3 supports simulating multiple transactions this includes declaring and immediately using a class (not currently possible via the gateway) support pathfinder_getTransactionStatus which is exposed on all RPC routes this enables querying a transactions current status, including whether the gateway has received or rejected it RPC returns int for entrypoint offsets instead of hex RPC rejects Fee values with more than 32 digits RPC does not expose pathfinder_getProof on v0.3 route This is a minor bugfix release, primarily to fix an issue with syncing on testnet2. pathfinder sometimes spams nethermind L1 nodes pathfinder stops syncing testnet2 at block 95220 due to a Sierra class compilation issue starknet v0.11.0 support RPC API v0.3 partial support removed several deprecated config options requires python 3.9 or 3.10 (no longer 3.8) support for state commitment and class commitment in pathfinder_getProof support for starknet v0.11 partial support for RPC specification v0.3 exposed on /rpc/v0.3/ route missing support for starknet_estimateFee and starknet_simulate starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee JSON-RPC methods return more detailed error messages python version requirement has changed to 3.9 or 3.10 (was 3.8 or 3.9 previously) RPC accepts hex inputs for Felt without '0x' prefix. This led to confusion especially when passing in a decimal string which would get silently interpreted as hex. using a Nethermind Ethereum endpoint occasionally causes errors such as could not be found to be logged. sync can miss new block events by getting stuck waiting for pending data. --config configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1)) --integration configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1)) --sequencer-url configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1)) --testnet2 configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1)) starknet_addDeployTransaction as this is no longer an allowed transaction since starknet v0.10.3 RPC api version 0.1, which used to be served on path /rpc/v0.1 We added support for v0.3 and removed v0.1. We still support v0.2 at both /rpc/v0.2 and /rpc (default) routes. In summary: / # serves v0.2 /rpc/v0.2/ # serves v0.2 /rpc/v0.3/ # serves v0.3 We are missing starknet_estimateFee and starknet_simulate support for v0.3, which will be added in an upcoming release. Note: this only applies if you are building from source. This does not impact docker users. Pathfinder requires python to support the starknet VM used to simulate starknet transactions and function calls. Previous versions of the VM only worked with python 3.8 or 3.9 which was a hassle because most operating systems no longer directly support it. The new version of the VM bundled with starknet v0.11 now requires python version 3.9 or 3.10. Several configuration options are now removed, after they were deprecated in pathfinder v0.4.1. Here is a migration guide: --testnet2: use --network testnet2 instead --integration: use --network integration instead --sequencer-url: use --network custom in combination with --feeder-gateway-url and gateway-url --config: use environment variables or env files as an alternative Hotfix for a bug introduced in the previous version v0.4.4, which prevented a new node from syncing on blocks near genesis. Added Newton FAQ links to readme Node fails to sync old blocks @SecurityQQ made their first contribution in #799 This minor release contains some nice performance improvements for starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee as well as some minor bug fixes. Also included is a major new feature: storage proofs - big thanks @pscott for his hard work on this feature! This is available via the pathfinder_getProof method which is served from both the pathfinder and Starknet endpoints for convenience: /rpc/pathfinder/v0.1/pathfinder_getProof /rpc/v0.2/pathfinder_getProof The method is specified here. Its results can be used to formally verify what a contract’s storage values are without trusting the pathfinder node. This is achieved by validating the merkle-proof that pathfinder returns and confirming that it correctly matches the known Starknet state root. storage proofs via pathfinder_getProof by @pscott starknet_getEvents returns all events when from_block=\"latest\" v0.1 starknet_getStateUpdate does not contain nonces Improved performance for starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee by caching classes Improved performance for starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee by using Rust for hashing @pscott made their first contribution in #726 The primary purpose of this release is to properly support testnet2 after the Starknet v0.10.3 update. The v0.10.3 update changed the testnet2 chain ID which impacts transaction signatures which in turn meant that starknet_estimateFee would fail for any signed transaction. This release updates pathfinder to use the correct chain ID. Testnet2 and integration flags are ignored starknet_estimateFee uses wrong chain ID for testnet2 Updated to cairo-lang 0.10.3 Contains several bug fixes, mostly hotfixes for bugs introduced in v0.4.1. Document that --chain-id expects text as input Testnet2 and integration L1 addresses are swapped (bug introduced in v0.4.1) Proxy network setups can’t sync historical blocks (bug introduced in v0.4.1) ABI serialization for starknet_estimateFee for declare transactions Soft deprecation of some configuration options Support custom Starknet gateways Pathfinder RPC extensions at /rpc/pathfinder/ with pathfinder_version method starknet_events optimisations fix block timestamp in pending calls Custom Starknet gateway support This release introduces support for custom Starknets. You can select this network by setting --network custom and specifying the --gateway-url and --feeder-gateway-url options. Several configuration options have been soft deprecated. This means using them will continue to work as before (no breaking change), but they will emit a warning when used. They will be removed in a future version, so please migrate to the newer options. To re-emphasize: your current configuration setup will continue to work as is. --testnet2 and --integration have been deprecated in favor of --network testnet2 and --network integration. --sequencer-url has been deprecated in favor of --network custom along with --gateway-url, --feeder-gateway-url and --chain-id. In addition, you will need to rename your existing database file to custom.sqlite as this will be the expected filename for custom networks. --config has been deprecated and will not be supported in the future. The utility this provided was valuable. Unfortunately it is starting to severely hinder how fast we can implement configuration changes and we decided to remove it. We suggest using environment variables along with environment files to configure pathfinder in a similar fashion. The following configuration options are now marked as deprecated: --testnet2, --integration, --config, --sequencer-url Optimized starknet_events for queries with both a block range and a from address Block timestamps for pending in starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee were using the latest timestamp instead of the pending one. This meant contracts relying on accurate timestamps could sometimes fail unexpectedly. Custom Starknet support Pathfinder specific RPC extensions hosted at /rpc/pathfinder/v0.1. Currently, this only contains pathfinder_version which returns the pathfinder version of the node. This release contains a breaking change, and also adds support for Starknet v0.10.2. The changes themselves are quite simple, but please read through each section as there are some caveats which might impact you when you apply this update. This release changes the version of the RPC that is served at the root route, from v0.1 to v0.2 of the RPC specification. Version v0.1 is still available at the /rpc/v0.1/ endpoint. This is the only breaking change in this release. Here is a summary of what routes are currently available, and what’s changed: / serves v0.2 (changed from v0.1) /rpc/v0.1 serves v0.1 (no change) /rpc/v0.2 serves v0.2 (no change) If possible, we recommend that you use the version specific routes as this will prevent such breaking changes from impacting you. This release includes an update to the cairo-vm embedded in pathfinder in order to support the upcoming v0.10.2 Starknet release. This bundled vm is a pre-release and may therefore contain differences to the final version used once Starknet updates testnet and mainnet. We will of course issue a new release if / when there is a new vm. Since these changes are not yet live on testnet nor mainnet, this means upgrading to this release will cause deviations between what pathfinder outputs and what can be expected on the network. More specifically, starknet_estimateFee will compute different fees until the network has upgraded to Starknet v0.10.2. If you don’t need the RPC route changes, it may be pertinent to delay updating until closer to the v0.10.2 release dates on testnet and mainnet. The expected timeline for these upgrades is ~17/11 for testnets and ~24/11 for mainnet.","title":"Pathfinder  release notes","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"pathfinder-versions","url":"/starknet-versions/pathfinder-versions/","titles":[{"text":"[0.6.6] - 2023-07-10  (latest)","hash":"0_6_6_2023_07_10_latest","id":1},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed","id":2},{"text":"[0.6.5] - 2023-07-07","hash":"0_6_5_2023_07_07","id":3},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_2","id":4},{"text":"Changed","hash":"changed","id":5},{"text":"[0.6.4] - 2023-07-05","hash":"0_6_4_2023_07_05","id":6},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_3","id":7},{"text":"[0.6.3] - 2023-06-29","hash":"0_6_3_2023_06_29","id":8},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_4","id":9},{"text":"Changed","hash":"changed_2","id":10},{"text":"[0.6.2] - 2023-06-29","hash":"0_6_2_2023_06_29","id":11},{"text":"Added","hash":"added","id":12},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_5","id":13},{"text":"Changed","hash":"changed_3","id":14},{"text":"[0.6.1] - 2023-06-18","hash":"0_6_1_2023_06_18","id":15},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_6","id":16},{"text":"[0.6.0] - 2023-06-14","hash":"0_6_0_2023_06_14","id":17},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_7","id":18},{"text":"Changed","hash":"changed_4","id":19},{"text":"[0.5.6] - 2023-05-25","hash":"0_5_6_2023_05_25","id":20},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_2","id":21},{"text":"[0.5.5] - 2023-05-18","hash":"0_5_5_2023_05_18","id":22},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_3","id":23},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_8","id":24},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_9","id":25},{"text":"v0.5.4","hash":"v0_5_4","id":26},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_4","id":27},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_10","id":28},{"text":"v0.5.3","hash":"v0_5_3","id":29},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_5","id":30},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_11","id":31},{"text":"v0.5.2","hash":"v0_5_2","id":32},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_6","id":33},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_12","id":34},{"text":"v0.5.1","hash":"v0_5_1","id":35},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_13","id":36},{"text":"v0.5.0","hash":"v0_5_0","id":37},{"text":"Highlights","hash":"highlights","id":38},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_7","id":39},{"text":"Changed","hash":"changed_5","id":40},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_14","id":41},{"text":"Removed","hash":"removed","id":42},{"text":"RPC API","hash":"rpc_api","id":43},{"text":"Python requirement","hash":"python_requirement","id":44},{"text":"Configuration changes","hash":"configuration_changes","id":45},{"text":"v0.4.5","hash":"v0_4_5","id":46},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_8","id":47},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_15","id":48},{"text":"New contributors","hash":"new_contributors","id":49},{"text":"v0.4.4","hash":"v0_4_4","id":50},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_9","id":51},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_16","id":52},{"text":"Changed","hash":"changed_6","id":53},{"text":"New contributors","hash":"new_contributors_2","id":54},{"text":"v0.4.3","hash":"v0_4_3","id":55},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_17","id":56},{"text":"Changed","hash":"changed_7","id":57},{"text":"v0.4.2","hash":"v0_4_2","id":58},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_10","id":59},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_18","id":60},{"text":"v0.4.1","hash":"v0_4_1","id":61},{"text":"Highlights","hash":"highlights_2","id":62},{"text":"Configuration option deprecation","hash":"configuration_option_deprecation","id":63},{"text":"Network selection","hash":"network_selection","id":64},{"text":"Gateway proxy","hash":"gateway_proxy","id":65},{"text":"Configuration file","hash":"configuration_file","id":66},{"text":"Changed","hash":"changed_8","id":67},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_19","id":68},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_11","id":69},{"text":"v0.4.0- (breaking release)","hash":"v0_4_0_breaking_release","id":70},{"text":"Default RPC version change","hash":"default_rpc_version_change","id":71},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.2 support","hash":"starknet_v0_10_2_support","id":72}]},"40":{"id":40,"text":"You can subscribe to get the latest version updates delivered to your inbox at Starknet Roadmap & version updates.

Blob gas on Starknet is now 5x cheaper (!) using: Squashing discount factor: Users pay for the expected marginal contribution of their transaction to the blobs sent to L1 State diff compression: Starknet submits compressed state diffs to L1. To better lends itself to the new compression scheme as well as allow its construction to be based on the state diff alone, the uncompressed encoding of contract diff headers changes to: \\[\\underbrace{\\text{new_nonce (if changed)}}_{\\text{64 bits}} | \\underbrace{\\text{n_updates}}_{\\text{8 or 64 bits}} | \\underbrace{\\text{n_updates_len}}_{\\text{1 bit}} | \\underbrace{\\text{flag}}_{\\text{1 bit}}\\] where: The semantics of flag is unchanged (i.e., it indicates whether or not the class was replaced) n_updates_len is 0 if the number of updates is less than 256 (and therefore can fit in 8 bits), and 1 otherwise n_updates can spread over 8 or 64 bits, depending on n_updates_len If the nonce of the contract is unchanged, the value of new_nonce is zero (and not the unchanged nonce) Starknet v0.13.3 post in the Starknet community forum Fall roadmap updates post on the Starknet community forum Optimistic parallelization in the sequencer. Applicative recursion (\"blockpacking\"): pack a contiguous sequence of blocks into a single L1 state update, instead of just one block. This change also affects the Starknet core contract on L1 and the structure of data availability: The contract will store also the hash of the \"aggregator\" program, alongside the hash of the Starknet OS. The LogStateUpdate event will be emitted once for every sequence of blocks in an applicative tree, rather than for every block. The data posted on L1 is now the output of the aggregator, instead of the OS. The OsOutputHeader struct will contain four new fields: prev_block_number, prev_block_hash, os_program_hash, full_output. New block hash definition: see the reference implementation here. All objects containing the block hash will use the new block hash computation. Receipts will contain a new property total_gas_consumed, only for transactions after v0.13.2. Three new builtins can appear in the builtin_instance_counter property of execution_resources in the transaction receipts: add_mod, mul_mod and range_check96. End support for the endpoints get_block_traces and get_transaction_trace. No changes in v0.13.2. The new JSON RPC version v0.8.0 will be released alongside Starknet v0.13.3. A new compiler version will be released for v0.13.2, Cairo v2.7.0. This includes a Sierra upgrade to v1.6.0, i.e. contracts compiled with the new compiler will only be accepted on Starknet v0.13.2 onwards. The Starknet-related features that will be added in this Cairo version include: sha256 syscall - syscall for computing sha256 on an arbitrary length input: High level code for using sha256/ Syscall cost - the dominant part of the syscall is ~1.1k bitwise builtin applications which today costs ~180 L1 gas (the 2k steps are negligible in comparison). The syscall is applied once for ~14 u32. Circuit builtin - the new compiler version will introduce a way to define ad-hoc algebraic circuits in Cairo. Circuits use the new mul_mod and add_mod builtins under the hood. Example usage can be found in circuit_test.cairo. Errors prettifying: execution errors are becoming more structured, which will be the basis for better error handling in the next JSON RPC version, resulting in nice error displays by wallets. Community Forum Posts: Starknet v0.13.2 pre-release notes Optimistic parallelization revived Upcoming Feature: Starknet Applicative Recursion Cairo v2.7.0 is coming! In response to community feedback, Starknet 0.13.1.1 reduces class declaration fees and increases the calldata limit: Resource Gas cost (0.13.1) Gas cost (0.13.1.1) CASM bytecode 28 gas/felt 1 gas/felt Sierra bytecode 28 gas/felt 1 gas/felt ABI 0.875 gas/character 0.032 gas/character Entity Limit (0.13.1) Limit (0.13.1.1) Calldata length (felts) 4,000 5,000 Cheaper data availability (DA): Starknet uses EIP-4844. State diffs are now blobs, rather than calldata, requiring the addition of data_gas to the Starknet block header. Time-related syscalls when called from an account contract’s __validate__, __validate_deploy__, __validate_declare__, or constructor function: block_timestamp returns the hour, rounded down. block_number returns the block number, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 100. Optimization: Load into memory only the functions in a contract that are actually used when generating the proof. The block header includes the following new fields: l1_da_mode: A string enum that takes the value CALLDATA or BLOB, and indicates whether EIP-4844 is the data availability solution that is used for the block. Also appears in pending block. l1_data_gas_price: Contains price_in_wei and price_in_fri, where 1 fri is 10-18 STRK. Also appears in pending block. l1_gas_price: Replaces eth_l1_gas_price and strk_l1_gas_price. Contains the data gas price (EIP-4844) in addition to the regular gas price. Starknet 0.13.1 is backward compatible with starknet_api_openrpc.json v0.6.0. Responses from 0.13.1 can be mapped naturally into v0.6.0 objects. A new version of starknet_api_openrpc.json, 0.7.0, accommodates the changes introduced by Starknet using EIP-4844. BLOCK_HEADER includes two new fields to support EIP-4844: l1_data_gas_price: contains price_in_wei and price_in_fri (10-18 denominations, similar to v0.6.0). l1_da_mode: An enum that indicates whether this block will use calldata or blobdata and can take the following values: CALLDATA BLOB FEE_ESTIMATE Includes two new fields: data_gas_consumed data_gas_price overall_fee is now: gas_consumed × gas_price + data_gas_consumed × data_gas_price Fee estimates will change depending on the data availability solution used by current Starknet blocks. For example, if you estimate the fee against the pending block, and it’s currently using CALLDATA, then nodes are expected to return data_gas_consumed=0 and compute the fee similarly to today, that is, get higher estimates. Receipts and traces now include data availability resources COMMON_RECEIPT_PROPERTIES, the main receipt object, now includes a new entry: execution_resources. The EXECUTION_RESOURCES object now includes the field data_availability. Note that the resources of internal calls will remain the same/ For more information, see the PR for the API JSON RPC specs EXECUTION_RESOURCES Computation resources are separated from data availability resources. This is done by introducing the data_availability property, which includes l1_gas and l1_data_gas, which were consumed due to DA requirements. One of these will always be zero, depending on whether or not the block uses calldata or blobs, as specified by the l1_da_mode field in the block header. Syscall costs are now included in the execution resources of traces and receipts. These are costs that are already being paid for but were not reported so far. A Cairo step now costs 0.0025 gas/step, a 50% reduction. All builtins costs are accordingly reduced by 50%. Each felt in the calldata and signature arrays of all transaction types now costs 0.128 gas/felt. Each felt of a sierra_program in the contract class and of bytecode in the compiled contract class now costs 28 gas/felt. v1 DECLARE transactions only include bytecode. Each character in the ABI costs 0.875 gas. An additional felt to the data array of an event now costs 0.128 gas/felt, similar to calldata. An additional felt to the keys array now costs 0.256 gas/felt. Starknet now supports multiple L1 providers. Community Forum Posts: Starknet v0.13.1: EIP4844 Support, More Fee Reductions, Stability, Quality of Life Starknet v0.13.1: Fee Reduction Data availability with EIP4844 Starknet v0.13.1 pre-release notes Starknet v0.13.0 is live on Mainnet. Starknet 0.13.0 includes the following changes: v3 transactions, including: Fee payment in STRK Reserved fields for future features, such as Volition and payment master get_block API: The gas_price field is replaced by the eth_l1_gas_price and strk_l1_gas_price fields. This change applies also to existing blocks. For more information on the new fields, see the JSON RPC API Spec on GitHub Sierra v1.4.0. This new version of Sierra is part of Crate v2.4.0, in the Cairo 2.4.0 package. For more information, see Cairo v2.4.0 is out! on the Community forum. Improved performance of secp256k1_mul and secp256r1_mul syscalls Computation cost is reduced by approximately 50% as a result of reduced Cairo steps and increased use of builtins. L1 data availability cost is reduced by approximately 10%-25%. For an ERC-20 transfer, the DA fee reduction is 25%. Starknet v0.12.3 is live on Mainnet. This release partially removes support for the Starknet feeder gateway. For details, see Feeder Gateway Deprecation in Development Proposals on the Starknet community forum. Additionally, this version includes the following changes: Performance optimizations in the gateway, the computation of the Patricia storage root, and block hash Support for secp256r1 syscalls in the Starknet OS. Restriction for __validate__ and the constructor of DeployAccount transactions: Restrict access to sequencer_address in the get_execution_info syscall by returning 0's for the address. Restrict access to the following syscalls: Cairo contracts: get_block_hash Cairo 0 contracts: get_sequencer_address This version is available on both Goerli and Sepolia testnets. Move structs that are common to secp256k1 and secp256r1 to a separate file. Starknet v0.12.2 is live on Mainnet. This version includes the following changes: Enabling P2P Authentication: An additional endpoint in the sequencer gateway to provide a signature on the state diff commitment and block hash. Resolving Mismatches in Queries: An extension to the get_state_update endpoint in the sequencer gateway that returns both the pending state diff and the pending block together. Increased maximum Cairo steps per transaction from 1 million to 3 million. Starknet v0.12.1 is live on Mainnet. This version includes the following changes: Mempool Validation. Inclusion of Failed Transactions. Keccak builtin. Starknet v0.12.0 is live on Mainnet. This version contains the following changes: Use the rust blockifier and LambdaClass’s Cairo VM to accelerate the sequencer’s time to handle transactions. Support version 2.0.0 of the Cairo compiler. Replace the PENDING status of transactions to ACCEPTED_ON_L2 - once a transaction is in that status it means that it will be included in a block, this applies to transactions - blocks still have the PENDING status. Add an experimental get_block_hash syscall. Change HTTP error code from 500 to 400 on API errors. Starknet v0.11.2 is live on Mainnet. This version contains the following changes: Upgrade Cairo 1.0 version to v1.0.0-rc0 (Cairo 1.0 activated on Starknet!) Starknet v0.11.1 is live on Mainnet. This version contains the following changes: Upgrade Cairo 1.0 version to v1.0.0-rc0. Charged transaction fee is now based on an average Ethereum gas price instead of a single sample (estimation API is unaffected). API changes: Remove the state root in get_state_update for pending blocks to allow faster responses in future versions. Testing framework: Allow declaring (and interacting with) Cairo 1.0 contracts. Currently, the Cairo 1.0 ABI is not supported yet, so a Cairo 0 ABI should be supplied to declare() manually. Split deploy() to two phases declare and deploy: deprecated_declare() (for Cairo 0 contract) or declare() (for Cairo 1.0 contracts) and deploy() (for both). Add current block hash to the Starknet Core Contract (currently not verified by the Starknet OS): Breaking change: The LogStateUpdate event’s data is changed to include blockHash. Starknet v0.11.0 is live on Mainnet. invoke and declare transactions of version 0 are no longer supported on this version. In Starknet v0.11.0, you can declare, deploy and run Cairo 1.0 smart contracts. We also introduce a new system call that allows a smooth transitioning of existing contracts to a Cairo 1.0 implementation. Historically, contract classes have been defined in terms of Cairo assembly, or Casm for short (the class definition also included more information needed for execution, e.g., hint data). The novelty of Cairo 1.0 is the introduction of Sierra (Safe Intermediate Representation), an intermediate layer between Cairo 1.0 and Casm. The introduction of Cairo 1.0 and Sierra has several effects on the system. Below we list the effects on each component; of particular note are: A new version of the declare transaction, which allows sending the new class structure The state commitment will now include contract classes Changes to the onchain data format New system call - replace_class The deploy transaction is no longer supported on this version. This version contains the following changes: Starknet Performance - Separate the state commitment computation from the execution of the transactions Add starknet-class-hash command to compute the class hash of a compiled Starknet contract Cairo: Autoformatter: Automatically break lines inside expressions This version introduces sequencer parallelization! This is the first step in our roadmap of performance upgrades. Details about the specific mechanism of parallelization and the roadmap in general are described in this medium post. A new endpoint, estimate_fee_bulk, is added to the feeder gateway. This will allow estimating the fee of several transactions at once, where each transaction is executed relative to the resulting state from applying the previous one. Sequencing performance improvements Builtin ratio changes, which affects builtin costs Add estimate_fee_bulk API that computes the fee of multiple transactions that will be executed consecutively As part of this version, we will also increase the finality of transactions in the pending block, by fixing the timestamp at the time of the block creation. This will solve the issue of transactions moving from pending to rejected on account of too old timestamp This version contains the following changes: Starknet: Add DeployAccount transaction (which will replace the Deploy transaction for deploying account contracts). To use it, you should first add enough funds to your account address to pay the transaction fee, and then you can invoke DeployAccount Split the starknet deploy_account CLI command into starknet new_account and starknet deploy_account Account contracts that are expected to be deployed this way should implement the`validate_deploy()` entry point, which should check the signature of the DeployAccount transaction Improve L1 fee computation: the fee is computed according to the diff of the storage state API: Remove entry_point_type field from transaction information Cairo: Add uint256_mul_div_mod to uint256.cairo This version introduces the next step in Starknet’s account abstraction design, specifically the validate/execute separation. See here for more information. This version contains the following changes: Starknet: Contract (breaking changes): @external and @view functions should be imported directly by the main compiled file. Otherwise, they will not be usable as external functions Forbid using the same storage variable name in two modules New transaction version (version 1) for invoke and declare transactions: Transactions of version 0 are deprecated and will not be supported in Starknet from the next version (v0.11.0). Please update your systems to use the new version In order to use transactions of version 1 you will need to upgrade your account contracts Add nonce field to the transactions. Nonce validation is now part of the Starknet protocol and is enforced to be executed sequentially Invoke: Split execute to two functions:` validate` (only validates the transaction) and execute (only executes the transaction) Remove the selector (which is now always execute) field, following the above change. Declare: declare transaction should now be sent from an account (and is validated using validate_declare in the account contract) Support fee for sending L1 messages. At this point, it’s not mandatory and messages with no fee will still be handled. Starting from the next version it will become mandatory. Cairo: Syntax changes in Cairo (to make it more similar to rust and C++): You can use the cairo-migrate script to convert old code to the new syntax. Use the -i flag to apply the changes to the files End statements with ; New lines are still part of the language at this point, and you cannot put more than one instruction per line. This will change in Cairo1.0. Use { … } for code blocks (instead of : and end) Add () around the condition of if statements Remove the member keyword in structs Change comment to use // instead of # Use …​, ap` instead of `...; ap in low level Cairo code Support return types that are not tuples. For example, func foo() → felt (instead of func foo() → (r: felt)) As a result, it’s now mandatory to specify return types. func foo() → (res) should be replaced by func foo() → (res: felt). The cairo-migrate tool does that automatically. Return statement accepts expressions, rather than only tuples. For example, you can write let x = (5,); return x; A few standard library functions were changed to return felt. The cairo-migrate script also fixes calls to those functions Support using functions as expressions This only applies to functions with → felt signature`, whose ap change is known at compile-time (e.g., recursive functions cannot be used this way) Fix a bug in the secp signature verification code that allowed a malicious prover to ignore the value of v (this does not let the prover fake a signature, but allows it to claim that a valid signature is invalid). Add Cairo code for the recursive STARK verifier Technical changes: * Move from python3.7 to python3.9 This version contains the following changes: Starknet: API changes: Add get_block_traces API - returns all the transaction traces of a given block Add a list of declared contracts in get_state_update Add a 0x prefix for class hash in the API Add starknet_version field for blocks (only applies to new blocks) Starknet CLI: Change the default block number to pending Using a wallet is the default, --no_wallet must be specified explicitly to override this Deploying contracts: Add deploy_contract function to the account contract created by starknet deploy_account Use this function to deploy contract (unless using --no_wallet). In particular, deploy should be used after declaring the contract (it expects the contract class hash) Support --dry_run to get the transaction information without signing or sending it Support deploy_from_zero in the deploy syscall to deploy a contract to an address that does not depend on the deployer Cairo: * Support and in if statements (if x == y and z == w). At the moment other boolean combinations are not supported This version introduces the contract class/instance paradigm into Starknet. See here for more information. This version contains the following changes: Starknet: Enforce fees - max_fee must not be set to zero, and selector must be execute Split the concepts of contract class and contract instance. Add declare transaction type New API and CLI commands: declare - Declares a contract class get_class_by_hash - Returns the contract class given its hash get_class_hash_at - Returns the class hash for a given contract instance address Rename delegate_call to library_call, and change the contract address argument to class hash. Add a deploy system call. Rename ContractDefinition to ContractClass Reduce the compiled contract file’s size by removing unnecessary identifiers (this optimization can be disabled using --dont_filter_identifiers) Cairo: Initial support for the EC-op builtin (scalar multiplication over the STARK curve). Not supported in Starknet yet. Add additional helper methods to blake2s.cairo, including big-endian support Technical changes: * Change function’s return type from a struct to a named tuple. In particular, foo.Return.SIZE is no longer supported.","title":"Release notes","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"version-notes","url":"/starknet-versions/version-notes/","titles":[{"text":"Starknet v0.13.3 (November 20, 24)","hash":"version0.13.3","id":1},{"text":"Additional resources","hash":"additional_resources","id":2},{"text":"Starknet v0.13.2 (August 28, 24)","hash":"version0.13.2","id":3},{"text":"New features and enhancements","hash":"new_features_and_enhancements","id":4},{"text":"API changes","hash":"api_changes","id":5},{"text":"Feeder gateway","hash":"feeder_gateway","id":6},{"text":"JSON RPC","hash":"json_rpc","id":7},{"text":"Cairo","hash":"cairo","id":8},{"text":"Others","hash":"others","id":9},{"text":"Additional resources","hash":"additional_resources_2","id":10},{"text":"Starknet v0.13.1.1 (April 15, 24)","hash":"version0.13.1.1","id":11},{"text":"Starknet v0.13.1 (March 13, 24)","hash":"version0.13.1","id":12},{"text":"New features and enhancements","hash":"new_features_and_enhancements_2","id":13},{"text":"Block header updates","hash":"block_header_updates","id":14},{"text":"API: JSON RPC","hash":"api_json_rpc","id":15},{"text":"Starknet API JSON RPC 0.6.0","hash":"starknet_api_json_rpc_0_6_0","id":16},{"text":"Starknet API JSON RPC 0.7.0","hash":"starknet_api_json_rpc_0_7_0","id":17},{"text":"Pricing changes","hash":"pricing_changes","id":18},{"text":"Computation","hash":"computation","id":19},{"text":"Calldata and signatures","hash":"calldata_and_signatures","id":20},{"text":"Class declaration","hash":"class_declaration","id":21},{"text":"Events","hash":"events","id":22},{"text":"Infrastructure updates","hash":"infrastructure_updates","id":23},{"text":"Additional resources","hash":"additional_resources_3","id":24},{"text":"Starknet v0.13.0 (Jan 10, 24)","hash":"version0.13.0","id":25},{"text":"Starknet v0.12.3 (Nov 19, 23)","hash":"version0.12.3","id":26},{"text":"Cairo 0","hash":"cairo_0","id":27},{"text":"Starknet v0.12.2 (Sep 04, 23)","hash":"version0.12.2","id":28},{"text":"Starknet v0.12.1 (Aug 21, 23)","hash":"version0.12.1","id":29},{"text":"Starknet v0.12.0 (July 12, 23)","hash":"version0.12.0","id":30},{"text":"Starknet v0.11.2 (May 31, 23)","hash":"version0.11.2","id":31},{"text":"Starknet v0.11.1 (May 23, 23)","hash":"version0.11.1","id":32},{"text":"Starknet v0.11.0 (Mar 29, 23)","hash":"version0.11.0","id":33},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.3 (Dec 12, 22)","hash":"version0.10.3","id":34},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.2 (Nov 29, 22)","hash":"version0.10.2","id":35},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.1 (Oct 25, 22)","hash":"version0.10.1","id":36},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.0 (Sept 05, 22)","hash":"version0.10.0","id":37},{"text":"Starknet v0.9.1 (July 20, 22)","hash":"version0.9.1","id":38},{"text":"Starknet v0.9.0 (June 06, 22)","hash":"version0.9.0","id":39}]},"42":{"id":42,"text":"A list of recommended full-nodes, open API endpoints, and API providers.

Where required, you must include these functions within your account contract. The logic of these functions can be mostly arbitrary, with a few limitations. For information on these limitations, see Limitations on validation. Table 1. Starknet account interface functions Function name When required __validate__ Always required __execute__ Always required. The signatures of __validate__ and __execute__ must be identical. At the moment of writing (Starknet 0.13.2), two critical validations must happen in __execute__, and their absence can lead to draining of the account’s funds: (1) assert!(get_caller_address().is_zero()) This asserts that the account’s __execute__ is not called from another contract, thus skipping validations (in later versions we may disallow calling execute from another contract at the protocol level) (2) assert!(get_tx_info().unbox().version.into() >= 1_u32) This asserts that the transaction’s version is at least 1, preventing the account from accepting INVOKE v0 transactions. It is critical to explicitly disallow the deprecated v0 transaction type, as v0 transactions assume that the signature verification happens in __execute__, and are thus skipping __validate__ entirely. __validate_declare__ Required for the account to be able to send a DECLARE transaction. This function must receive exactly one argument, which is the class hash of the declared class. __validate_deploy__ Required to allow deploying an instance of the account contract with a DEPLOY_ACCOUNT transaction. The arguments of __validate_deploy__ must be the class hash of the account to be deployed, the salt used for computing the account’s contract address, followed by the constructor arguments. You can only use the __validate_deploy__ function in an account contract to validate the DEPLOY_ACCOUNT transaction for that same contract. That is, this function runs at most once throughout the lifecycle of the account. constructor All contracts have a constructor function. It can be explicitly defined in the contract, or if not explicitly defined, the sequencer uses a default constructor function, which is empty. When the sequencer receives a transaction, it calls the corresponding validation function with the appropriate input from the transaction’s data, as follows: For an INVOKE transaction, the sequencer calls the __validate__ function with the transaction’s calldata as input. The transaction’s calldata will be deserialized to the arguments in the __validate__ function’s signature, it is up to the sender to make sure that the calldata is encoded appropriately according to validate’s signature. After successfully completing validation, the sequencer calls the __execute__ function with the same arguments. For a DEPLOY_ACCOUNT transaction, the sequencer calls the constructor function with the transaction’s constructor_calldata as input (as above, it is expected that the constructor’s calldata successfully desieralizes to the arguments in the constructor signature). After the successful execution of the constructor, the sequencer validates the transaction by calling the __validate_deploy__ function. For a DECLARE transaction, the sequencer validates the transaction by calling the __validate_declare__ function. For more information on the available transaction types and their fields, see Transaction types. For more information on the validation and execution stages, see Transaction lifecycle. Separating the validation and execution stages guarantees payment to sequencers for work completed and protects them from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The validation functions have limitations, described below, that are designed to prevent the following DoS attacks on the sequencer: An attacker could cause the sequencer to perform a large amount of work before a transaction fails validation. Two examples of such attacks are: Spamming INVOKE transactions whose __validate__ requires many steps, but eventually fails Spamming DEPLOY_ACCOUNT transactions that are invalid as a result of the constructor or __validate_deploy__ failing. The above attacks are solved by making sure that the validation step is not resource-intensive, e.g. by keeping the maximal number of steps low. However, even if the validation is simple, the following \"mempool pollution\" attack could still be possible: An attacker fills the mempool with transactions that are valid at the time they are sent. The sequencer is ready to execute them, thinking that by the time it includes them in a block, they will still be valid. Shortly after the transactions are sent, the attacker sends one transaction that somehow invalidates all the previous ones and makes sure it’s included in a block, e.g. by offering higher fees for this one transaction. An example of such an attack is having the implementation of __validate__ checks that the value of a storage slot is 1, and the attacker’s transaction later sets it to 0. Restricting validation functions from calling external contracts prevents this attack. The limitations listed here apply to the following validation functions: __validate__, __validate_deploy__, and __validate_declare__. A constructor, when run in a DEPLOY_ACCOUNT transaction. That is, if an account is deployed from an existing class via the deploy syscall, these limitations do not apply. The validation functions have the following limitations: You cannot call functions in external contracts, only in your account contract. This restriction enforces a single storage update being able to invalidate only transactions from a single account. However, be aware that an account can always invalidate its own past transactions by e.g. changing its public key. This limitation implies that the fees you need to pay to invalidate transactions in the mempool are directly proportional to the number of unique accounts whose transactions you want to invalidate. The maximum number of Cairo steps in each of the three validation functions is 1,000,000. The get_execution_info syscall behaves differently When raised from one of the validate functions: sequencer_address is set to zero block_timestamp returns the time (in UTC), rounded to the most recent hour. block_number returns the block number, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 100. The following syscalls cannot be called: get_block_hash get_sequencer_address (this syscall is only supported for Cairo 0 contracts). When the __validate__, __validate_deploy__, or __validate_declare__, function fails, the account in question does not pay any fee, and the transaction’s status is REJECTED. A transaction has the status REVERTED when the __execute__ function fails. A reverted transaction is included in a block, and the sequencer is eligible to charge a fee for the work done up to the point of failure, similar to Ethereum. Thanks to account abstraction, the logic of __execute__ and the different validation functions is up to the party implementing the account. To see a concrete implementation, see OpenZeppelin’s account component.

While not mandatory at the protocol level, you can use a richer standard interface for accounts, defined in Starknet Improvement Proposal #6 (SNIP-6). SNIP-6 was developed by community members at OpenZeppelin, in close collaboration with wallet teams and other Core Starknet developers. A valid account contract includes specific functions, depending on the type of the contract. For more information, see Account interface function reference. In Starknet, similar to Ethereum, every contract has a nonce, including an account contract. This nonce is sequential. The nonce of a transaction sent from an account must match the nonce of that account. After the transaction is executed, whether or not it is reverted, the nonce is incremented by one. In Starknet, only the nonce of account contracts, that is, those adhering to the above structure, can be non-zero. In contrast, in Ethereum, regular smart contracts, known as Contract Accounts, as opposed to Externally Owned Accounts can increment their nonce by deploying smart contracts, that is, executing the CREATE and CREATE2 opcodes. For more information on accounts in Ethereum, see Ethereum Accounts in the Ethereum documentation. A nonce serves two important roles: It guarantees transaction hash uniqueness, which is important for a good user experience. It provides replay protection to the account: Because the signature is bound to a particular nonce, a malicious party cannot replay the transaction. Starknet currently determines the nonce structure at the protocol level to be sequential. In the future, Starknet will consider a more flexible design, extending account abstraction to nonce management, previously referred to as nonce abstraction.","title":"Starknet’s account interface","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"approach","url":"/architecture-and-concepts/accounts/approach/","titles":[{"text":"Account functions","hash":"account_functions","id":1},{"text":"Replay protection","hash":"replay_protection","id":2}]},"54":{"id":54,"text":"You can deploy a new account in the following ways: Send a DEPLOY_ACCOUNT transaction.

When deploying using the UDC, the sequencer executes the __validate__ function in the contract of the sender’s address. Executes the constructor with the given arguments.

Through an account, you can send transactions and interact with other contracts. In order for you to own an onchain asset, such as an ERC-20 token or an NFT, that asset must be associated with your account address. Within Ethereum individual user accounts are known as Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). EOAs differ from smart contracts in that EOAs are not controlled by code, but rather by a pair of private and public keys. The account’s address is derived from those keys and only by possessing the private key can you initiate transactions from an account. While Ethereum contracts are passive, that is, they can only change if they were called inside a transaction, EOAs can initiate transactions. While simple, because the signature scheme is fixed, EOAs have some drawbacks, including the following: Control over the private key gives complete control over the account, so you must keep your seed phrase secure yet accessible. Limited flexibility surrounding wallet functionality EIP-4337 is a design proposal for Ethereum that outlines account abstraction, whereby all accounts are managed via a dedicated smart contract on the Ethereum network, as a way to increase flexibility and usability. You can add custom logic on top of the basic EOA functionality, thereby bringing account abstraction into Ethereum. Account abstraction enables more flexible account management. Rather than the protocol determining an account’s behavior, an account contract, which is a smart contract with programmable logic, defines a user’s account. Using account abstraction you can now program how your account functions. For example, you can: Determine what it means for a signature to be valid, or what contracts your account is allowed to interact with. This is known as signature abstraction. Pay transaction fees in different tokens. This is known as fee abstraction. Design your own replay protection mechanism and allow sending multiple uncoupled transactions in parallel. In Ethereum, you cannot send two transactions in parallel, you must wait for confirmation of the first before sending the second. Otherwise, the second transaction can be rejected due to an invalid nonce. With account abstraction, a sequential nonce is not required. This is known as nonce abstraction. Today, Starknet offers signature abstraction. In the future, we will enrich the current account abstraction design. For example, see the paymaster proposal for fee abstraction in the Starknet Community Forum. Two examples of how you might program an account to function using account abstraction are: Social recovery A process where if you lose your wallet, you are able to retrieve it via a selected social network, vastly improving the typical experience of wallet recovery. Operating your account via facial recognition With signature abstraction, you can use your phone’s native hardware to sign transactions, making it practically impossible to take control of another user’s account, even if your phone is stolen.","title":"What is an account?","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"introduction","url":"/architecture-and-concepts/accounts/introduction/","titles":[{"text":"Ethereum account structure","hash":"ethereum_account_structure","id":1},{"text":"What is Account Abstraction?","hash":"account_abstraction","id":2},{"text":"Examples of customizing account functionality","hash":"examples","id":3}]},"56":{"id":56,"text":"The key stages of transaction lifetime are: The sequencer selects a transaction from the mempool and calls the __validate__ function.

As the names suggest, the origin-dependent type includes the deployer’s address in the address calculation, whereas, the origin-independent type does not. The unique boolean parameter ultimately determines the type of deployment. When deploying a contract that uses get_caller_address in the constructor calldata, remember that the UDC, not the account, deploys that contract. Therefore, querying get_caller_address in a contract’s constructor returns the UDC’s address, not the account’s address. By making deployments dependent upon the origin address, users can reserve a whole address space to prevent someone else from taking ownership of the address. Only the owner of the origin address can deploy to those addresses. Achieving this type of deployment necessitates that the origin sets unique to true in the deployContract call. Under the hood, the function call leverages the origin’s address and creates a hashchain by hashing the origin’s address with the given salt. To deploy a unique contract address pass: let deployed_addr = udc.deployContract(class_hash, salt, true, calldata.span()); Origin-independent contract deployments create contract addresses independent of the deployer and the UDC instance. Instead, only the class hash, salt, and constructor arguments determine the address. This type of deployment enables redeployments of accounts and known systems across multiple networks. To deploy a reproducible deployment, set unique to false. let deployed_addr = udc.deployContract(class_hash, salt, false, calldata.span()); The UDC has already been deployed on most networks and development environments. The standard requires the UDC to be deployed passing deploy_from_zero=true and salt=0 as arguments to the deploy syscall. This results in a deterministic and predictable address across all instances of Starknet, facilitating SDK integration and reproducibility of deployments.

For each affected contract, the following information is sent as calldata on L1: The contract address A single 32-byte word that includes the nonce and the following meta information about the update: class information flag, whose value is one of the following: 0 Storage updates only. 1 The contract was deployed or replaced in this state update. When this flag is set to 1, the new class hash occupies an additional word before the storage updates section. number of storage updates The expected format of this 32-byte word is as follows: \\[\\underbrace{0\\cdots0}_{\\text{127 bits}}| \\underbrace{\\text{class information flag}}_{\\text{1 bit}}| \\underbrace{\\text{new nonce}}_{\\text{64 bits}}|{ \\underbrace{\\text{# of storage updates}}_{\\text{64 bits}}}_{\\text{LSB}}\\] Each storage update includes the following: key - the address inside the contract’s storage where the value is updated value - the new value Newly declared classes include the following: The number of Cairo classes that were declared in the block Each class includes the following: The class hash The compiled class hash Consider the following onchain data that was extracted from L1: [ 1, (1) 2019172390095051323869047481075102003731246132997057518965927979101413600827, (2) 18446744073709551617, (3) 100, (4) 200, (4) 1, (5) 1351148242645005540004162531550805076995747746087542030095186557536641755046, (6) 558404273560404778508455254030458021013656352466216690688595011803280448032 (7) ] 1 The number of contracts whose state was updated. 2 The address of the first, and only, contract whose state changed. 3 18446744073709551617, which is 264+1, encodes the following: The class information flag is 0, that is, the contract was not deployed or replaced just now, so you shouldn’t treat the next word as the class hash.

For information about messaging fees that are paid on L1, see L1 → L2 message fees. At the time of writing, the following components are contributing to the transaction fee: Computational complexity: The marginal cost of verifying the transaction on L1, measured in L1 gas. Onchain data: The cost of posting the state diffs induced by the transaction to L1 (for more details, see data availability). This is measured in L1 gas or L1 data gas, depending on whether or not the L2 block in which the transaction was included uses calldata or blobs. L2→L1 messages: Messages sent to L1 are eventually sent to the Starknet core contract as L1 calldata by the sequencer; therefore L2 transaction that send L2→L1 messages incur an additional L1 gas cost. L2 calldata, events and code: From Starknet 0.13.1 onwards, there is a per-byte (or per felt) price for L2 payloads. For more details, see L2 payloads. The fee is charged atomically with the transaction execution on L2. The Starknet OS injects a transfer of the fee-related ERC-20, with an amount equal to the fee paid, the sender equal to the transaction submitter, and the sequencer as a receiver. Each transaction is associated with an estimate of the amount of gas used. Combining this estimate with the price of gas yields the estimated fee. For transactions prior to v3, the fee is denominated in WEI. For transactions v3 and later, the fee is denominated in STRK. With v3 transactions, users specify the max amount and max price for each resource. At the time of writing, the only available resource is L1 gas. In the future, we will introduce L2 gas which will be used to price L2 work (as opposed to only charging for the proof verification in L1 gas, which is what happens today). With older transaction versions, users specify the maximum fee that they are willing to pay for a transaction. The only limitation on the sequencer, which is enforced by the Starknet OS, is that the actual fee charged is bounded by max_fee. While not enforced in the proof, the Starknet sequencer usually charges less than max_fee, as it charges in accordance with the above fee formula. The fee of transactions can be estimated with using starknet_estimateFee API call, which is part of Starknet’s API v0.7.0 and above. For more information, see the Starknet JSON RPC specification. For more information on how to construct the appropriate resource_bounds based on the response of starknet_estimateFee, see How to use the new fee estimates? on the Starknet community forum. This section shows the formula for determining a transaction’s fee. The following sections describe how this formula was derived. Starting with Starknet v0.13.1, Starknet distinguishes between blocks whose state diffs are sent to L1 as calldata and blocks whose state diffs are sent to L1 as blobs. The l1_da_mode property in the Starknet block header contains this information. The cost of computation remains the same on both options, but the cost related to data availability differs. The following formula describes the overall fee, \\(F\\), for a transaction in blocks whose state diffs are sent to L1 as blobs: \\[\\begin{align} F = \\; & gas\\_price \\cdot \\Bigg(\\max_k v_k w_k + \\\\ & \\quad + \\; \\text{message_calldata_cost}\\cdot 3t + (\\text{message_calldata_cost} + \\text{l1_log_data_cost})\\cdot \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^t q_i \\; + \\\\ & \\quad + \\; \\left(\\text{l1_storage_write_cost}+\\text{log_message_to_l1_cost}\\right)\\cdot t + \\; \\\\ & \\quad + \\; \\text{l2_payload_costs}\\Bigg) + \\\\ & data\\_gas\\_price\\cdot\\text{felt_size_in_bytes}\\cdot\\bigg(2(n-1)+2(m-1) + \\ell +2D \\bigg) \\end{align}\\] where: \\(v\\) is a vector that represents resource usage, where each of its entries, \\(v_k\\), corresponds to different resource types: Cairo steps and number of applications of each builtin. For more information see Calculation of computation costs. \\(w\\) is the CairoResourceFeeWeights vector. \\(n\\) is the number of unique contracts updated, which also includes changes to classes of existing contracts and contract deployments, even if the storage of the newly deployed contract is untouched. In other words, \\(n\\ge\\ell\\). Notice that \\(n\\ge 1\\) always holds, because the fee token contract is always updated, which does not incur any fee. \\(m\\) is the number of values updated, not counting multiple updates for the same key. Notice that \\(m\\ge 1\\) always holds, because the sequencer’s balance is always updated, which does not incur any fee. \\(t\\) is the number of L2→L1 messages sent, where the corresponding payload sizes are denoted by \\(q_1,...,q_t\\). \\(\\ell\\) is the number of contracts whose class was changed, which happens on contract deployment and when applying the replace_class syscall. \\(D\\) is 1 if the transaction is of type DECLARE and 0 otherwise. Declare transactions need to post on L1 the new class hash and compiled class hash which are added to the state. L2→L1 messaging constants: \\(\\text{message_calldata_cost}\\) is 1124 gas per 32-byte word. \\(\\text{l1_log_data_cost}\\) is 256 gas. \\(\\text{l1_storage_write_cost}\\) is the cost of writing to a new storage slot on Ethereum, which is 20,000 gas. \\(\\text{log_message_to_l1_cost}\\) is 1637 gas. For more information, see L2→L1 messages. \\(\\text{l2_payload_costs}\\) is the gas cost of data sent over L2. This includes calldata, code, and event emission. For more details see L2 payloads. \\(\\text{felt_size_in_bytes}\\) is 32, which is the number of bytes required to encode a single STARK field element. The following formula describes the overall fee, \\(F\\), for a transaction in blocks whose state diffs are sent to L1 as calldata: \\[\\begin{align} F = gas\\_price\\cdot&\\Bigg(\\max_k v_k w_k + \\\\ & + \\; \\text{da_calldata_cost}\\left(2(n-1)+2(m-1) + \\ell + 2D + 3t + \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^t q_i\\right)\\\\ & - \\; \\text{contract_update_discount}\\cdot (n-1) - 240 \\\\ & + \\; \\text{message_calldata_cost}\\cdot 3t + (\\text{message_calldata_cost} + \\text{l1_log_data_cost})\\cdot\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^t q_i \\\\ & + \\; \\left(\\text{l1_storage_write_cost}+\\text{log_message_to_l1_cost}\\right)\\cdot t \\\\ & + \\; \\text{l2_payload_costs}\\Bigg) \\end{align}\\] where: The following constants are defined in the same manner as in the blob-based formula: \\(v, w, n, m, t, \\ell, D\\) \\(\\text{message_calldata_cost}, \\; \\text{l1_log_data_cost}, \\; \\text{log_message_to_l1_cost}, \\; \\text{l1_storage_write_cost}\\) \\(\\text{l2_payload_costs}\\) \\(\\text{da_calldata_cost}\\) is 551 gas per 32-byte word. This cost is derived as follows: 512 gas per 32-byte word for calldata. ~100 gas for onchain hashing that happens for every sent word. a 10% discount, because the sequencer does not incur additional costs for repeated updates to the same storage slot within a single block. \\(240\\) is the gas discount for updating the sender’s balance, for the derivation of this number see Storage updates. \\(\\text{contract_update_discount}\\) is 312 gas, for the derivation of this discount see Storage updates. Every 60 seconds, Starknet samples the base price of gas and data gas on L1. The price of gas on Starknet is set to the average of the last 60 gas price samples, plus 1 gwei. The price of data gas on Starknet is set to the average of the last 60 data gas price samples. The data gas price on Ethereum is derived from the value of excess_blob_gas. For more information, see EIP-4844. Let’s analyze the correct metric for measuring transaction complexity. For simplicity, we will ignore Cairo’s builtins, and address them later. A Cairo program execution yields an execution trace. When proving a Starknet block, we aggregate all the transactions appearing in that block to the execution trace. Starknet’s prover generates proofs for execution traces, up to some maximal length \\(L\\), derived from the specs of the proving machine and the desired proof latency. Tracking the execution trace length associated with each transaction is simple. Each assertion over field elements, such as verifying addition/multiplication over the field, requires the same, constant number of trace cells, which is where our \"no-builtins\" assumption kicks in: Pedersen occupies more trace cells than addition. Therefore, in a world without builtins, the fee of the transaction \\(tx\\) is correlated with \\(\\text{TraceCells}[tx]/L\\). In the Cairo execution trace each builtin has its own slot, which is important to consider when determining the fee. For example, consider that the prover can process a trace with the following limits: up to 500,000,000 Cairo Steps up to 20,000,000 Pedersen hashes up to 4,000,000 signature verifications up to 10,000,000 range checks The proof is closed and sent to L1 when any of these slots is filled. Suppose that a transaction uses 10,000 Cairo steps and 500 Pedersen hashes. At most 40,000 such transactions can fit into the hypothetical trace (20,000,000/500). Therefore, its gas price correlates with 1/40,000 of the cost of submitting proof. Notice that this estimate ignores the number of Cairo steps, as it is not the limiting factor, since 500,000,000/10,000 > 20,000,000/500. With this example in mind, it is possible to formulate the exact fee associated with L2 computation. The allocation of resources among builtin operations must be predetermined; it is not possible to decide, post-execution, to include only 20,000,001 Pedersen hashes without additional components. This safeguards fairness and prevents manipulation, ensuring integrity in proof generation and fee determination. For each transaction, the sequencer calculates a vector, CairoResourceUsage, that contains the following: The number of Cairo steps. The number of applications of each Cairo builtin. For example, five range checks and two Pedersen hashes. The sequencer crosses this information with the CairoResourceFeeWeights vector. For each resource type, either a Cairo step or a specific builtin application, CairoResourceFeeWeights has an entry that specifies the relative gas cost of that component in the proof. Going back to the above example, if the cost of submitting a proof with 20,000,000 Pedersen hashes is roughly 5m gas, then the weight of the Pedersen builtin is 0.25 gas per application (5,000,000/20,000,000). The sequencer has a predefined weights vector, in accordance with the proof parameters. The sequencer charges only according to the limiting factor. Therefore the fee is correlated with: \\[\\max_k[\\text{CairoResourceUsage}_k \\cdot \\text{CairoResourceFeeWeights}_k]\\] where \\(k\\) enumerates the Cairo resource components, that is the number of Cairo steps and builtins used. The weights are listed in the following table: Resource Gas cost Cairo step 0.0025 gas/step Pedersen 0.08 gas/application Poseidon 0.08 gas/application Range check 0.04 gas/application ECDSA 5.12 gas/application Keccak 5.12 gas/application Bitwise 0.16 gas/application EC_OP 2.56 gas/application The onchain data associated with a transaction is composed of three parts Storage updates L2→L1 messages Deployed contracts Declared classes (only relevant for DECLARE transactions, and adds two additional words) Whenever a transaction updates some value in the storage of some contract, the following data is sent to L1: two 32-byte words per contract two 32-byte words for every updated storage value For information on the exact data and its construction, see Data availability. Only the most recent value reaches L1. So the transaction’s fee only depends on the number of unique storage updates. If the same storage cell is updated multiple times within the transaction, the fee remains that of a single update. The following formula describes the storage update fee for a transaction: \\[\\underbrace{\\textit{gas_price}\\left(\\text{da_calldata_cost} \\cdot 2(n-1) - \\text{contract_update_discount}\\cdot (n-1)\\right)}_{\\text{contract addresses + new nonce and number of storage updates }} \\\\ + \\\\ \\underbrace{\\textit{gas_price} \\cdot \\left(\\text{da_calldata_cost}(2(m-1))-240\\right)}_{\\text{storage updates}}\\] where: \\(n\\) is the number of unique contracts updated, which also includes changes to classes of existing contracts and contract deployments, even if the storage of the newly deployed contract is untouched. In other words, \\(n\\ge\\ell\\). Notice that \\(n\\ge 1\\) always holds, because the fee token contract is always updated at the end of each transaction, in order to update the sequencer’s and the sender’s balances. The fee token contract update is not taken into account when computing the fee. \\(m\\) is the number of values updated, not counting multiple updates for the same key. Notice that \\(m\\ge 1\\) always holds, because the sequencer’s balance is updated at the end of each transaction. The sequencer’s balance update is not taken into account when computing the fee. \\(\\text{contract_update_discount}\\) is 312 gas, which is discounted for every updated contract. This discount is a result of the fact that out of the \\(2n\\) words caused by updating contracts, \\(n\\) words are short, including at most 6 non-zero bytes: three bytes for the nonce two bytes for the number of storage updates one byte for the class information flag Taking into account that zero bytes only cost 4 gas, the cost difference between a full 32-byte word, which does not contain zeros, and a word with only six non-zero bytes is \\(32\\cdot16-(6\\cdot16+26\\cdot4)=312\\). \\(240\\) is the gas discount for updating the sender’s balance, and is derived by assuming the balance requires at most 12 non-zero bytes, which is enough for 1.2B ETH or STRK, resulting in the following discount: \\(512-(20\\cdot4+12\\cdot16)=240\\). Improvements to the above pessimistic estimation might be gradually implemented in future versions of Starknet. For example, if different transactions within the same block update the same storage cell, there is no need to charge for both transactions, because only the last value reaches L1. In the future, Starknet might include a refund mechanism for such cases. When a transaction that raises the send_message_to_l1 syscall is included in a state update, the following data reaches L1: L2 sender address L1 destination address Payload size Payload (list of field elements) Consequently, the gas cost associated with a single L2→L1 message is: \\[\\begin{align} \\text{MESSAGE_COST} = & \\; \\text{message_calldata_cost}\\cdot\\left(3+\\text{payload_size}\\right) \\; + \\\\ & + \\text{l1_log_data_cost}\\cdot\\text{payload_size} \\; + \\\\ & + \\text{log_message_to_l1_cost} \\; + \\\\ & + \\text{l1_storage_write_cost} \\end{align}\\] Where: \\(\\text{message_calldata_cost}\\) is 1124 gas. This is the sum of the 512 gas paid to the core contract on submitting the state update, and 612 gas paid for the submitting of the same word to the verifier contract (which incurs ~100 additional gas for hashing). That is, messages are sent to Ethereum twice. \\(\\text{log_message_to_l1_cost}\\) is 1637 gas. This is the fixed cost involved in emitting a LogMessageToL1 event. This event has two topics and a data array, which adds two data words to the event, resulting in a total of \\(375+2\\cdot 375+2\\cdot 256\\) gas (log opcode cost, topic cost, and two data words cost). \\(\\text{l1_log_data_cost}\\) is 256 gas, which is paid for every payload element during the emission of the LogMessageToL1 event. \\(\\text{l1_storage_write_cost}\\) is 20,000 gas per message which is paid in order to store the message hash on the Starknet core contract. This recording of the message is what later enables the intended L1 contract to consume the message. When a transaction that raises the deploy syscall is included in a state update, the following data reaches L1: contract address number of storage updates and the new nonce class hash The first two elements are counted in the number of unique modified contracts, denoted by \\(n\\) throughout this page.

Messaging is the mechanism that enables this interaction. For example, you can perform computations on L2 and use the result on L1. Bridges on Starknet use the L1-L2 messaging mechanism. Consider that you want to bridge tokens from Ethereum to Starknet. You deposit your tokens in the L1 bridge contract, which automatically triggers the minting of the same token on L2. Another good use case for L1-L2 messaging is Defi pooling. For more information, see DeFi pooling on StarkWare’s site and dApps on https://www.starknet.io. Be aware that the messaging mechanism is asynchronous and asymmetric. Asynchronous: Your contract code, whether Cairo or Solidity, cannot await the result of the message being sent on the other layer within your contract code’s execution. Asymmetric: Sending a message from Ethereum to Starknet, L1→L2, is fully automated by the Starknet sequencer, so the message is automatically delivered to the target contract on L2. However, when sending a message from Starknet to Ethereum, L2→L1, the sequencer only sends the hash of the message. You must then consume the message manually using a transaction on L1. Contracts on L2 can interact asynchronously with contracts on L1 using the L2→L1 messaging protocol. The protocol consists of the following stages: During the execution of a transaction, a contract on Starknet sends a message from L2 to L1 by calling the send_message_to_L1 syscall. The sequencer attaches the message parameters to the block that includes the syscall invocation. The message parameters include the address of the sender on L2, the address of the recipient contract on L1, and the message data. For example: let mut payload: Array = ArrayTrait::new(); let to_address: EthAddress = 1_felt252.try_into().unwrap(); payload.append(1); // potentially add more elements to payload (payload[1], payload[2], etc.) send_message_to_l1_syscall(to_address: to_address.into(), payload: payload.span()); The prover proves the state update that includes this transaction. The sequencer updates the L1 state. The message is stored on L1 in the Starknet Core Contract and a counter on the Core Contract increases by one. The processMessage function, which is part of the Starknet Core Contract, emits the LogMessageToL1 event, which contains the message parameters. The message recipient on L1 can access and consume the message by calling the consumeMessageFromL2 function, which includes the message parameters within the transaction. This function, which is part of the Starknet Core Contract, verifies the following: The hashes of the L2 sent message parameters, now stored on the Core Contract, and the L1 received message parameters, are the same. The entity calling the function is indeed the recipient on L1. In such a case, the counter corresponding to the message hash in the Starknet Core Contract decreases by one. For more information, see the consumeMessageFromL2 function in StarknetMessaging.sol. L2→L1 Messaging mechanism illustrates this flow: Figure 1. L2→L1 Messaging mechanism The structure of an L2 → L1 message is described as follows under MSG_TO_L1 in the Starknet API JSON RPC specification: from_address (felt252) The address of the L2 contract sending the message. to_address (EthAddress) The target L1 address the message is sent to. payload (Array) The payload of the message. The hash of an L2 → L1 message is computed on L1 as follows: keccak256( abi.encodePacked( FromAddress, uint256(ToAddress), Payload.length, Payload ) ); Sending an L2 to L1 message always incurs a fixed cost of 20,000 gas, because the hash of the message being sent must be written to L1 storage in the Starknet Core Contract. Contracts on L1 can interact asynchronously with contracts on L2 using the L1→L2 messaging protocol. The protocol consists of the following stages: An L1 contract induces a message to an L2 contract on Starknet by calling the sendMessageToL2 function on the Starknet Core Contract with the message parameters. The Starknet Core Contract hashes the message parameters and updates the L1→L2 message mapping to indicate that a message with this hash was indeed sent. The L1 contract records the fee that the sender paid. For more information, see L1 → L2 message fees. The message is then decoded into a Starknet transaction that invokes a function annotated with the l1_handler decorator on the target contract. Transactions like this on L2 are called L1 handler transactions. The Starknet sequencer, upon receiving enough L1 confirmations for the transaction that sent the message, initiates the corresponding L2 transaction. The L2 transaction invokes the relevant l1_handler function. The L1 Handler transaction that was created in the previous step is added to a proof. The Core Contract receives the state update. The message is cleared from the Core Contract’s storage to consume the message. Clearing the Core Contract’s storage does the following: incurs a fixed cost of 5,000 gas emits an L1 event logging the message consumption At this point, the message is handled. An L1→L2 message consists of the following: L1 sender’s address L2 recipient’s contract address Function selector Calldata array Message nonce The message nonce is maintained on the Starknet Core Contract on L1, and is incremented whenever a message is sent to L2. The nonce is used to avoid a hash collision between different L1 handler transactions that is caused by the same message being sent on L1 multiple times. For more information, see L1→L2 structure. The flow described here should only be used in edge cases such as bugs on the Layer 2 contract preventing message consumption. Consider that Alice sends an L1 asset to a Starknet bridge to transfer it to L2, which generates the corresponding L1→L2 message. Now, consider that the L2 message consumption doesn’t function, which might happen due to a bug in the dApp’s Cairo contract. This bug could result in Alice losing custody of their asset forever. To mitigate this risk, the contract that initiated the L1→L2 message can cancel it by declaring the intent to cancel, waiting five days, and then completing the cancellation. This delay protects the sequencer from a DoS attack in the form of repeatedly sending and canceling a message before it is included in L1, rendering the L2 block which contains the activation of the corresponding L1 handler invalid. The steps in this flow are as follows: The user that initiated the L1→L2 message calls the startL1ToL2MessageCancellation function in the Starknet Core Contract. The user waits five days until she can finalize the cancellation. The user calls the cancelL1ToL2Message function. An L1 → L2 message induces a transaction on L2, which, unlike regular transactions, is not sent by an account. This calls for a different mechanism for paying the transaction’s fee, for otherwise the sequencer has no incentive of including L1 handler transactions inside a block. To avoid having to interact with both L1 and L2 when sending a message, L1 → L2 messages are payable on L1, by sending ETH with the call to the payable function sendMessageToL2 on the Starknet Core Contract. The sequencer takes this fee in exchange for handling the message. The sequencer charges the fee in full upon updating the L1 state with the consumption of this message. The fee itself is calculated in the same manner as \"regular\" L2 transactions. You can use the CLI to get an estimate of an L1 → L2 message fee. For completeness, L1 → L2 structure describes the precise structure of both the message as it appears on L1 and the induced transaction as it appears on L2. Table 1. L1 → L2 message structure FromAddress ToAddress Selector Payload Nonce EthereumAddress FieldElement FieldElement List FieldElement The hash of the message is computed on L1 as follows: keccak256( abi.encodePacked( uint256(FromAddress), ToAddress, Nonce, Selector, Payload.length, Payload ) ); Version ContractAddress Selector Calldata Nonce FieldElement FieldElement FieldElement List FieldElement The hash of the corresponding L1 handler transaction on L2 is computed as follows: l1_handler_tx_hash = _h_( \"l1_handler\", version, contract_address, entry_point_selector, _h_(calldata), 0, chain_id, nonce ) Where: l1_handler is a constant prefix, encoded in bytes (ASCII), as big-endian. version is the transaction version. Only version 0 is currently supported. chain_id is a constant value that specifies the network to which this transaction is sent. h is the Pedersen hash (note that since we’re hashing an array, the # of inputs needs to be appended to the hash). 0 indicates that L1 to L2 message fees are charged on L1. In an L1 handler transaction, the first element of the calldata is always the sender’s Ethereum address. Since L1 handler transactions are not initiated by an account, invoking get_caller_address() or similar account-related functions returns the address 0x0. Table 2.

component—sequencers, provers, and nodes—playing a specific yet interconnected role. Although Starknet is not yet fully decentralized, it’s actively moving toward that goal. This description of the system’s roles and how they interact should help you better grasp the intricacies of the Starknet ecosystem. Starknet’s operation begins when a transaction is received by a gateway, which serves as the Mempool. This stage could also be managed by the sequencer. The transaction is initially marked as RECEIVED. The sequencer then incorporates the transaction into the network state and tags it as ACCEPTED_ON_L2. The final step involves the prover, which executes the operating system on the new block, calculates its proof, and submits it to Layer 1 (L1) for verification. For more information on the transaction flow, see Transaction lifecycle. In essence, Starknet’s architecture involves multiple components: The sequencer receives transactions, orders them, and produces blocks. It operates similarly to validators in Ethereum or Bitcoin. The prover generates proofs for the created blocks and transactions. It uses the Cairo Virtual Machine (Cairo VM) to run provable programs, thereby creating execution traces necessary for generating STARK proofs. L1, in this case, Ethereum, hosts a smart contract capable of verifying these STARK proofs. If the proofs are valid, Starknet’s state root on L1 is updated. Starknet’s state is a comprehensive snapshot maintained through Merkle trees, much like in Ethereum. This establishes the architecture of the validity roll-up and the roles of each component. Sequencers are the backbone of the Starknet network, similar to Ethereum’s validators. They usher transactions into the system. Validity Rollups, also known as ZK-Rollups, excel at offloading some network chores, like bundling and processing transactions, to specialized players. This setup is similar to how Ethereum and Bitcoin delegate security to miners. Sequencing, like mining, demands hefty resources. Validity Rollups like Starknet outsource transaction processing to specialized entities and then verify their work. These specialized entities, in the context of Validity Rollups, are known as sequencers. Instead of providing security, as miners do, sequencers provide transaction capacity. They order, that is, sequence, multiple transactions into a single batch, execute them, and produce a block that is later proved by the prover and submitted to the Layer 1 network as a single, compact proof, known as a rollup. Just as validators in Ethereum and miners in Bitcoin are specialized actors securing the network, sequencers in Validity Rollup-based networks are specialized actors that provide transaction capacity. This mechanism enables Validity Rollups to handle a higher volume of transactions while maintaining the security of the underlying Ethereum network, enhancing scalability without compromising on security. Sequencers follow a systematic method for processing transactions: Sequencing: They collect transactions from users and order them. Executing: Sequencers then process these transactions. Batching: Transactions are grouped together in batches for efficiency. Block Production: Sequencers produce blocks that contain batches of processed transactions. Sequencers must be reliable and highly available, as their role is critical to the network’s smooth functioning. They need powerful and well-connected machines to perform their role effectively, as they must process transactions rapidly and continuously. The current roadmap for Starknet includes decentralizing the sequencer role. This shift towards decentralization will enable more participants to become sequencers, contributing to the robustness of the network. Provers serve as the second line of verification in the Starknet network. Their main task is to validate the work of the sequencers, when they receive the block produced by the sequencer, and to generate proofs that these processes were correctly performed. A prover does the following: Receives blocks: Provers receive blocks of processed transactions from sequencers. Processes blocks: Provers process these blocks a second time, ensuring that all transactions within the block have been correctly handled. Generates a proof: After processing, provers generate a proof of correct transaction processing. Sends the proof to Ethereum: Finally, the proof is sent to the Ethereum network for validation. If the proof is correct, the Ethereum network accepts the block of transactions. Provers need even more computational power than sequencers because they have to calculate and generate proofs, a process that is computationally heavy. However, the work of provers can be split into multiple parts, allowing for parallelism and efficient proof generation. The proof generation process is asynchronous, meaning it doesn’t have to occur immediately or in real-time. This flexibility allows for the workload to be distributed among multiple provers. Each prover can work on a different block, allowing for parallelism and efficient proof generation. The design of Starknet relies on these two types of actors—sequencers and provers—working in tandem to ensure efficient processing and secure verification of transactions. The relationship between sequencers and provers in blockchain technology often sparks debate. A common misunderstanding suggests that either the prover or the sequencer is the main bottleneck. To set the record straight, let’s discuss the optimization of both components. Starknet, which uses the Cairo programming language, currently supports only sequential transactions. Plans are in place to introduce parallel transactions in the future. However, as of now, the sequencer operates one transaction at a time, making it the bottleneck in the system. In contrast, provers operate asynchronously and can execute multiple tasks in parallel. The use of proof recursion allows for task distribution across multiple machines, making scalability less of an issue for provers. When it comes to defining what nodes do in Bitcoin or Ethereum, people often misinterpret their role as keeping track of every transaction within the network. This, however, is not entirely accurate. Nodes serve as auditors of the network, maintaining the state of the network, such as how much Bitcoin each participant owns or the current state of a specific smart contract. They maintain network state by processing transactions and preserving a record of all transactions, but that is a means to an end, not the end itself. In Validity Rollups and specifically within Starknet, this concept is somewhat reversed. Nodes don’t necessarily have to process transactions to get the state. In contrast to Ethereum or Bitcoin, Starknet nodes aren’t required to process all transactions to maintain the state of the network. You can access network state data by using the Starknet API, which uses the JSON RPC protocol, to communicate with a node. Previously, Starknet’s Gateway and Feeder Gateway APIs enabled querying the sequencer, but as the network has matured, the JSON RPC has become the standard. Operating your own node is typically faster than using a shared architecture, like the gateway. It’s worth noting that more people running nodes increases the resilience of the network and prevents server flooding, which has been an issue in other L2 networks. Currently, there are primarily three methods for a node to keep track of the network’s state and nodes can implement any of these methods: Replaying Old Transactions: Like Ethereum or Bitcoin, a node can take all the transactions and re-execute them. Although this approach is accurate, it isn’t scalable unless you have a powerful machine that’s capable of handling the load. If you can replay all transactions, you can become a sequencer. Relying on L2 Consensus: Nodes can trust the sequencer to execute the network correctly. When the sequencer updates the state and adds a new block, nodes accept the update as accurate. Checking Proof Validation on L1: Nodes can monitor the state of the network by observing L1 and ensuring that every time a proof is sent, they receive the updated state. This way, they don’t have to trust anyone and only need to keep track of the latest valid transaction for Starknet. Each type of node setup comes with its own set of hardware requirements and trust assumptions. Nodes that replay transactions require powerful machines to track and execute all transactions. These nodes don’t have trust assumptions; they rely solely on the transactions they execute, guaranteeing that the state at any given point is valid. Nodes that rely on L2 consensus require less computational power. They need sufficient storage to keep the state but don’t need to process a lot of transactions. The tradeoff here is a trust assumption. Currently, Starknet revolves around one sequencer, so these nodes trust StarkWare not to disrupt the network. However, once a consensus mechanism and leader election amongst sequencers are in place, these nodes will only need to trust that a sequencer who staked their stake to produce a block is not willing to lose it. Nodes that only update their state based on proof validation on L1 require the least hardware. They have the same requirements as an Ethereum node, and once Ethereum light nodes become a reality, maintaining such a node could be as simple as using a smartphone. The only tradeoff is higher latency. Proofs are sent to Ethereum intermittently, not for every block, resulting in delayed state updates. Plans are in place to produce proofs more frequently, even if they are not sent to Ethereum immediately, lowering node latency.","title":"Starknet architecture: Overview","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"starknet-architecture-overview","url":"/architecture-and-concepts/network-architecture/starknet-architecture-overview/","titles":[{"text":"Transaction flow","hash":"transaction_flow","id":1},{"text":"Starknet’s state","hash":"starknets_state","id":2},{"text":"Sequencers","hash":"sequencers","id":3},{"text":"Provers","hash":"provers","id":4},{"text":"Optimizing sequencers and provers: Debunking common misconceptions","hash":"optimizing_sequencers_and_provers_debunking_common_misconceptions","id":5},{"text":"Nodes","hash":"nodes","id":6},{"text":"Nodes that replay transactions","hash":"nodes_that_replay_transactions","id":7},{"text":"Nodes that rely on L2 consensus","hash":"nodes_that_rely_on_l2_consensus","id":8},{"text":"Nodes that check proof validation on L1","hash":"nodes_that_check_proof_validation_on_l1","id":9}]},"67":{"id":67,"text":"Starknet’s state consists of: Contract classes a mapping between the class hash and the class definition Contract instances a mapping between addresses (251-bit field elements) and the contract’s state A contract instance’s state consists of: Class hash defines the functionality of the contract Contract storage a key-value mapping where the key/values are field elements Contract nonce the number of transactions sent from this contract A transaction \\(tx\\) transitions the system from state \\(S\\) to state \\(S'\\) if: \\(tx\\) is an Invoke transaction, and the storage of \\(S'\\) is the result of executing the target contract code with respect to the previous state \\(S\\). The arguments, contract instance’s address, and the specific function entry point are part of the transaction. \\(tx\\) is a Deploy account transaction, and \\(S'\\) contains the new contract instance’s state at the contract instance’s address. Additionally, the storage of \\(S\\) is updated according to the execution of the contract instance’s constructor. \\(tx\\) is a Declare transaction, and \\(S'\\) contains the class hash and definition in the contract class’s mapping The state commitment is a digest that represents the state. In Starknet, the state commitment combines the roots of two binary Merkle-Patricia tries of height 251 in the following manner: state_commitment = hPos( \"STARKNET_STATE_V0\", contract_trie_root, class_trie_root ) Where: hPos is the Poseidon hash function. STARKNET_STATE_V0 is a constant prefix string encoded in ASCII (and represented as a field element). contract_trie_root is the root of the contract trie, a Merkle-Patricia trie whose leaves are the contracts' states. class_trie_root is the root of the class trie, a Merkle-Patricia trie whose leaves are the compiled class hashes. As with Ethereum, this trie is a two-level structure, whose leaves correspond to distinct contracts. The address of each contract determines the path from the trie’s root to its corresponding leaf, whose content encodes the contract’s state. The information stored in the leaf is as follows: hPed( hPed( hPed( class_hash, storage_root ), nonce ), 0 ) Where: hPed is the Pedersen hash function. class_hash is the hash of the contract’s definition. storage_root is the root of another Merkle-Patricia trie of height 251 that is constructed from the contract’s storage. nonce is the current nonce of the contract. The class trie encodes the information about all existing classes in Starknet’s state. This trie maps class hashes to their compiled class hashes. The information stored in a leaf at a path corresponding to some class hash is as follows: hPos( CONTRACT_CLASS_LEAF_V0, compiled_class_hash ) Where: hPos is the Poseidon hash function CONTRACT_CLASS_LEAF_V0 is a constant prefix string encoded in ASCII (and represented as a field element). compiled_class_hash is the hash of the Cairo assembly resulting from compiling the given class via the Sierra-to-Casm compiler. Compiled class hash The compiled class hash identifies the output of a specific Casm compilation as unique. Cairo classes that are part of the state commitment are defined with Sierra, an intermediate representation between Cairo and Cairo assembly (Casm). However, the prover only works with Casm. So in order to prevent needing to compile from Sierra to Casm in every block in which the class is used, the state commitment must have some information about the corresponding Cairo assembly. The compiled class hash provides this information. For more information, see Cairo and Sierra. The party that declares the contract signs the compiled class hash, which they obtain using an SDK, as part of the DECLARE transaction. If the transaction is included in a block, then the compiled class hash becomes part of the state commitment. In the future, when Sierra-to-Casm compilation becomes part of the Starknet OS, this value might be updated via a proof of the Sierra-to-Casm compiler execution, showing that compiling the same class with a newer compiler version results in some new compiled class hash. The state commitment scheme uses a binary Merkle-Patricia trie with the Pedersen hash function. Each node in the trie is represented by a triplet \\((length, path, value)\\), where: \\(length\\) is the length of the path, measured in nodes. \\(path\\) is the path from the current node to its unique non-empty subtrie. \\(path\\) is an integer in the set \\(\\{0,\\ldots,2^{length}-1\\}\\), and the binary expansion of \\(path\\) indicates how to proceed along the trie, as follows: Expand \\(path\\) to its binary representation. Starting with the most significant bit, representing the root of the trie, traverse the tree node by node, where the bit values \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) indicate left and right, respectively. \\(value\\) is the value of the node, which can be either data, or the hash of two non-empty child nodes. An empty node is one whose triplet values are \\((0,0,0)\\). Leaf nodes and internal nodes can be empty. A subtrie rooted at a node \\((length, path, value)\\) has a single non-empty subtrie, rooted at the node obtained by following the path specified by \\(path\\). Length is specified, and cannot be deduced from \\(path\\), because the numbers in the triplet \\((length, path, value)\\) are field elements of fixed size, 251 bits each. For a node where \\(length>0\\), \\(path\\) leads to the highest node whose left and right children are not empty. The following rules specify how the trie is constructed from a given set of leaves: The hash of a node \\(N =(length, path, value)\\), denoted by \\(H(N)\\), is: \\[H(N)=\\begin{cases} value, & \\text{if } length = 0 \\\\ h_{Ped}(value, path) + length, & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\\] All arithmetic operations in the above description of \\(H\\) are done in the STARK field, as described in The STARK field. The triplet representing the parent of the nodes \\(left=(\\ell_L, p_L, v_L)\\), \\(right=(\\ell_R, p_R, v_R)\\) is defined as follows: \\[parent= \\begin{cases} (0,0,0), & \\text{if } left=right=(0,0,0)\\\\ (\\ell_L + 1, p_L, v_L), & \\text{if } right=(0,0,0) \\text{ and } left \\neq (0,0,0)\\\\ (\\ell_R + 1, p_R + 2^{\\ell_R}, v_R), & \\text{if } right\\neq (0,0,0) \\text{ and } left = (0,0,0)\\\\ (0, 0, h_{Ped}(H(left), H(right))), & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\\] The diagram A three-level Merkle-Patricia trie illustrates the construction of a three-level-high Merkle-Patricia trie from the leaves whose values are \\((0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0)\\): Figure 1. A three-level Merkle-Patricia trie Where \\(r=h_{Ped}(H(2,2,1),H((2,1,1))\\). Notice that the example does not skip from the root, whose length is zero, so the final state commitment to the trie is \\(H((0,0,r))=r\\). Suppose that you want to prove, with respect to the state commitment just computed, that the value of the leaf whose path is given by \\(101\\) is \\(1\\). In a standard Merkle trie, the proof would consist of data from three nodes, which are siblings along the path to the root. In a Merkle-Patricia trie, because the trie is sparse, you only need to send the two children of the root, which are \\((2,2,1)\\) and \\((2,1,1)\\). These two children are enough to reproduce the state commitment \\(r\\), and because you know that the height of the trie is three, and that it is fixed, you know that the path \\(01\\) of length \\(2\\) specified by the right-hand child, \\((2,1,1)\\), leads to the desired leaf. Starknet uses special contract addresses to provide distinct capabilities beyond regular contract deployment. Two such addresses are 0x0 and 0x1. These addresses are reserved for specific purposes and are characterized by their unique behavior in comparison to traditional contract addresses. Address 0x0 functions as the default caller_address for external calls, including interactions with the L1 handler or deprecated Deploy transactions. Unlike regular contracts, address 0x0 does not possess a storage structure and does not accommodate storage mapping. Address 0x1 is another special contract address within Starknet’s architecture. It functions as a storage space for mapping block numbers to their corresponding block hashes. The storage structure at this address is organized as follows: Keys Block numbers between \\(\\text{first_v0_12_0_block}\\) and \\(\\text{current_block - 10}\\). Values Corresponding block hashes for the specified blocks. Default Values For all other block numbers, the values are set to 0. The storage organization of address 0x1 supports the efficient retrieval of block hashes based on block numbers within a defined range and is also used by the get_block_hash system call.","title":"Starknet state","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"starknet-state","url":"/architecture-and-concepts/network-architecture/starknet-state/","titles":[{"text":"Transitioning to a new state","hash":"transitioning_to_a_new_state","id":1},{"text":"State commitment","hash":"state_commitment","id":2},{"text":"The contract trie","hash":"contracts_trie","id":3},{"text":"The class trie","hash":"classes_trie","id":4},{"text":"Merkle-Patricia trie","hash":"merkle_patricia_trie","id":5},{"text":"About nodes","hash":"about_nodes","id":6},{"text":"Trie construction","hash":"trie_construction","id":7},{"text":"Mathematical definition of the nodes in the trie","hash":"mathematical_definition_of_the_nodes_in_the_trie","id":8},{"text":"Example trie","hash":"example_trie","id":9},{"text":"Special addresses","hash":"special_addresses","id":10},{"text":"Address 0x0","hash":"address_0x0","id":11},{"text":"Address 0x1","hash":"address_0x1","id":12}]},"68":{"id":68,"text":"The high-level steps in the Starknet transaction lifecycle are as follows: Transaction submission: A transaction is submitted to one of the gateways, which functions as the mempool, and marks the transaction status as RECEIVED. Mempool validation: The mempool performs a preliminary validation on the transaction, such as ensuring that the current account balance exceeds the value of max_fee (prior to v3 transactions) or assuring the transaction’s calldata length is within the legal limit. If the transaction is invalid, it does not proceed. Mempool validation in this context is analogous to Ethereum’s signature checking, including running the account’s __validate__ function on an INVOKE transaction, __validate_declare__ on a DECLARE transaction, or __validate_deploy__ on a DEPLOY_ACCOUNT transaction, ensuring that the current account balance exceeds the value of max_fee (prior to v3 transactions), and more. Sequencer validation: The sequencer performs preliminary validation on the transaction before executing it to ensure that the transaction is still valid. If the transaction is invalid, it does not proceed. This validation stage repeats the same validation run during the mempool validation. Execution: The sequencer operation sequentially applies all transactions that passed the preliminary validation to the state. If a transaction fails during execution, it is included in the block with the status REVERTED. Proof generation and verification: The Prover executes the operating system on the new block, computes the proof, and transmits it to the L1 verifier, which verifies the proof. At this point, the L1 state is updated to include the transaction. The diagram below illustrates how each transaction status fits into the overall transaction flow: The following are the possible statuses of a transaction from the moment a user sends it until the moment it passes the L1 verifier: Status type Status Explanation Finality NOT_RECEIVED The transaction is not yet known to the sequencer. RECEIVED The transaction was received by the mempool. The transaction now either executes successfully, is rejected, or reverted. The transaction has no execution status. REJECTED The transaction was received by the mempool but failed validation in the sequencer. Such transactions are not included in a block. The transaction has no execution status. A rejected transaction is stored in the mempool. You cannot send another transaction with the same transaction hash. ACCEPTED_ON_L2 The transaction was executed and entered an actual created block on L2. ACCEPTED_ON_L1 The transaction was accepted on Ethereum. Execution REVERTED The transaction passed validation but failed during execution in the sequencer. It is included in the block with the status REVERTED. Since only INVOKE transactions have an execution phase, DEPLOY_ACCOUNT and DECLARE transactions cannot be reverted. If either the __VALIDATE_DEPLOY__ or the __VALIDATE_DECLARE__ function fails when run in the sequencer, then the transaction is rejected. SUCCEEDED The transaction was successfully executed by the sequencer. It is included in the block. When a transaction is marked as REVERTED, the following state implications occur: Nonce increases The nonce value for the account of the failed transaction iterates despite the failure. Fee charge The sequencer charges a fee for the execution of the transaction up to the point of failure. A Transfer event is emitted. Partial reversion All changes that occurred during the validation stage are not reverted. However, all changes that occurred during the execution stage are reverted, including all messages to L1 or any events that were emitted during this stage. Events might still be emitted from the validation stage or the fee charge stage. Fee calculation The fee charged for REVERTED transactions is the smaller of the following two values: The maximum fee that the user is willing to pay, either max_fee (pre-v3 transactions) or \\(\\text{max_amount} \\cdot \\text{max_price_per_unit}\\) (v3 transactions). The total consumed resources. Consumed Resources The resources used for the execution of the transaction up to the point of failure. This includes Cairo steps, builtins, syscalls, L1 messages, events, and state diffs during the validation and execution stages. To get a receipt, use the JSON RPC method starknet_getTransactionReceipt. The transaction receipt contains the following fields: transaction_hash The hash of the transaction. actual_fee The actual fee paid for the transaction. finality_status The finality status of the transaction. execution_status The execution status of the transaction. block_hash The hash of the block that includes the transaction block_number The sequential number of the block that includes the transaction messages_sent A list of messages sent to L1. events The events emitted. execution_resource A summary of the execution resources used by the transaction. type The type of the transaction.

INVOKE Invokes an existing function in a contract. DEPLOY_ACCOUNT Deploys new account contracts in smart wallets. To see how these transaction types appear in the Starknet API, see starknet_api_openrpc.json. This topic describes the available fields for these transaction types and how each transaction’s hash is calculated. When the fields that comprise a transaction change, either with the addition of a new field or the removal of an existing field, then the transaction version increases. Deprecated transaction versions are still supported, but support will be removed in a future release of Starknet. Table 1. Supported versions of Starknet transaction types Transaction name Current version Deprecated versions Unsupported versions INVOKE v3 v1, v0 N/A DECLARE v3 v2, v1 v0 DEPLOY_ACCOUNT v3 v1 N/A DEPLOY N/A N/A v0 Additionally, see information on the L1 handler transaction type. Do not submit a transaction that uses an unsupported transaction type, because it cannot be included in a proof, and so cannot become part of a Starknet block. While the L1HandlerTransaction type is a valid transaction type within Starknet, be aware that it cannot be broadcast through the Starknet API like the other transaction types listed in the table above. This transaction type is specifically designed for internal Starknet operations, particularly for handling messages from L1 to L2. For more details, refer to the L1 handler transaction page. The INVOKE transaction type invokes a function in an existing contract instance. The contract code of the account that sends the INVOKE transaction determines how to process the transaction. Because an account’s __validate__ and __execute__ functions can contain any logic, the account ultimately determines how to handle the INVOKE transaction. Every INVOKE transaction in Starknet undergoes the validation and execution stages, initiated by the __validate__ and __execute__ functions. The validation stage verifies that the account that sent the transaction approves it. Field name Type Description account_deployment_data List For future use. Currently this value is always empty.

Next, the developer would submit the compilation output, the contract class, to the Starknet sequencer via a DECLARE transaction. Starting with Cairo 1.0, the contract class resulting from compiling Cairo 1.0 does not include Casm. Instead of Casm, it includes instructions in an intermediate representation called Safe Intermediate Representation, Sierra for short. This new contract class is then compiled by the sequencer, via the Sierra → Casm compiler, to generate the Cairo assembly associated with this class. The Casm code is then executed by the Starknet OS. Starknet is a validity rollup, which means that the execution inside every block needs to be proven, and this is where STARKs come in handy. However, STARK proofs can address statements that are formulated in the language of polynomial constraints, and have no knowledge of smart contract execution. To overcome this gap, we developed Cairo. Cairo instructions, previously referred to as Casm, are translated to polynomial constraints that enforce the correct execution of a program according to the Cairo semantics defined in Cairo-a Turing-complete STARK-friendly CPU architecture. Thanks to Cairo, we can formulate the statement \"This Starknet block is valid\" in a way that we can prove. Be aware that we can only prove things about Casm. That is, regardless of what the user sends to the Starknet sequencer, what’s proven is the correct Casm execution. This means that we need a way to translate Sierra into Casm, and this is achieved with the Sierra → Casm compiler. To understand why we chose to add an additional layer between the code that the user writes (Cairo 1.0) and the code that is being proven (Casm), we need to consider more components in the system, and the limitations of Cairo. A crucial property of every decentralized L2 is that the sequencers are guaranteed to be compensated for the work they do. The notion of reverted transactions is a good example: even if the user’s transaction failed mid execution, the sequencer should be able to include it in a block and charge execution fees up to the point of failure. If the sequencer cannot charge for such transactions, then sending transactions that will eventually fail (after a lot of computation steps) is an obvious DoS attack on the sequencer. The sequencer cannot look at a transaction and conclude that it would fail without actually doing the work (this is equivalent to solving the halting problem). The obvious solution to the above predicament is to include such transactions in the block, similar to Ethereum. However, this may not be as simple to do in a validity rollup. With Cairo 0, there is no separating layer between user code and what is being proven. This means that users can write code which is unprovable in some cases. In fact, such code is very easy to write, e.g. assert 0=1 is a valid Cairo instruction that cannot be proven, as it translates to polynomial constraints that are not satisfiable. Any Casm execution that contains this instruction cannot be proven. Sierra is the layer between user code and the provable statement, that allows us to make sure all transactions are eventually provable. The method by which Sierra guarantees that user code is always provable is by compiling Sierra instructions to a subset of Casm, which we call \"safe Casm\". The important property that we require from safe Casm is being provable for all inputs. A canonical example for safe Casm is using if/else instructions instead of assert, that is, making sure all failures are graceful. To better understand the considerations that go into designing the Sierra → Casm compiler, consider the find_element function from the common library of Cairo 0: func find_element{range_check_ptr}(array_ptr: felt*, elm_size, n_elms, key) -> (elm_ptr: felt*) { alloc_locals; local index; %{ ... %} assert_nn_le(a=index, b=n_elms - 1); tempvar elm_ptr = array_ptr + elm_size * index; assert [elm_ptr] = key; return (elm_ptr=elm_ptr); } Below we abuse the \"Casm\" notation by not distinguishing Cairo 0 from Casm and referring to the above as Casm (while we actually refer to the compilation result of the above). For brevity, we have omitted the hint in the above snippet, but it’s clear that this function can only execute correctly if the requested element exists in the array (otherwise it would fail for every possible hint - there is nothing we can substitute index for, that makes the following lines run successfully). Such Casm cannot be generated by the Sierra→Casm compiler. Furthermore, simply replacing the assertion with an if/else statement doesn’t do, as this results in non-deterministic execution. That is, for the same input, different hint values can yield different results. A malicious prover can use this freedom to harm the user - in this example, they are able to make it seem as if an element isn’t part of the array, even though it actually is. The safe Casm for finding an element in an array behaves like the above snippet in the happy flow (element is there): an index is given in a hint, and we verify that the array at the hinted index contains the requested element. However, in the unhappy flow (element isn’t there), we must go over the entire array to verify this. This was not the case in Cairo 0, as we were fine with certain paths not being provable (in the above snippet, the unhappy flow in which the element isn’t in the array is never provable). Sierra’s gas metering adds further complications to the above example. Even looking through the array to verify that the element isn’t there may leave some flexibility to the prover. If we take gas limitations into consideration, the user may have enough gas for the happy flow, but not for the unhappy one, making the execution stop mid-search, and allowing the prover to get away with lying about the element not being present. The way we plan to handle this is by requiring the user to have enough gas for the unhappy flow before actually calling find_element. Smart contracts written with Cairo 1.0 cannot contain user defined hints. This is already true with Cairo 0 contracts (only whitelisted hints are accepted), but with Cairo 1.0 the hints in use are determined by the Sierra → Casm compiler. Since this compilation is there to ensure that only \"safe\" Casm is generated, there is no room for hints that are not generated by the compiler. In the future, native Cairo 1.0 may contain hint syntax similar to Cairo 0, but it will not be available in Starknet smart contracts (L3s on top of Starknet may make use of such functionality). Note that this is currently not part of Starknet’s roadmap.","title":"Cairo and Sierra","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"cairo-and-sierra","url":"/architecture-and-concepts/smart-contracts/cairo-and-sierra/","titles":[{"text":"Why do we need Casm?","hash":"why_do_we_need_casm","id":1},{"text":"Why do we need Sierra?","hash":"why_do_we_need_sierra","id":2},{"text":"Reverted transactions, unsatisfiable AIRs, and DoS attacks","hash":"reverted_transactions_unsatisfiable_airs_and_dos_attacks","id":3},{"text":"Safe Casm","hash":"safe_casm","id":4},{"text":"Hints in Cairo 1.0","hash":"hints_in_cairo_1_0","id":5}]},"71":{"id":71,"text":"Builtins in Cairo are predefined optimized low-level execution units that the Cairo VM refers to in order to perform predefined computations that are expensive to perform in standard Cairo.

This process is managed by the Sierra→Casm compiler. The compiled class hash is crucial for ensuring the uniqueness and integrity of compiled classes within Starknet. Whether you are a developer deploying contracts or a party interested in the inner workings of Starknet’s state commitment, understanding the compiled class hash is essential. For developers, the hash is an important part of the contract declaration process, ensuring that each compiled class is uniquely identifiable and verifiable. For those involved in maintaining the network, it contributes to the efficiency and performance of Starknet by optimizing the state commitment process. The state commitment uses the Sierra code that results when compiling Cairo classes. Sierra acts as an intermediate representation between Cairo and Casm. Provers, however, operate solely with Casm. In order to avoid recompiling, from Sierra to Casm, each block in which the class is deployed, the state commitment gets the information it needs about the corresponding Casm from the the information contained in the compiled class hash. When declaring a contract, the party administering the contract endorses the compiled class hash, procured using an SDK, as an integral component of the DECLARE transaction. Following the inclusion of the transaction in a block, the compiled class hash integrates into the state commitment. Uniqueness: The compiled class hash ensures the uniqueness of each compiled class. It is essentially a fingerprint for the compiled output, allowing the network to verify the integrity and uniqueness of the class. State Commitment: In Starknet, state commitment includes various components, including the Cairo classes. These classes are initially defined using Sierra. However, for the prover to function efficiently, it requires Casm. Efficiency: By including the compiled class hash in the state commitment, Starknet avoids the need to recompile from Sierra to Casm in every block where the class is used. This optimization significantly enhances the network’s efficiency and performance. When a new contract is declared on Starknet, the compiled class hash plays a pivotal role. Here’s how: Declaration Process: The party declaring the contract computes the compiled class hash using an SDK provided by Starknet. DECLARE Transaction: This hash is then included as part of the DECLARE transaction is a specific type of transaction in Starknet used to register new contracts. Inclusion in State Commitment: Once the DECLARE transaction is included in a block, the compiled class hash becomes part of the state commitment. This inclusion ensures that the network recognizes and stores the unique compiled output of the contract. Prospectively, as Sierra-to-Casm compilation integrates into the Starknet OS, the value might undergo updates via proof of the Sierra-to-Casm compiler execution. Such verification demonstrates that compiling the same class with an updated compiler version yields a fresh compiled class hash. The compiled class hash is a basic element in Starknet’s architecture, enabling efficient state commitment and ensuring the integrity and uniqueness of compiled classes.","title":"Compiled class hash","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"compiled-class-hash","url":"/architecture-and-concepts/smart-contracts/compiled-class-hash/","titles":[{"text":"Purpose and Significance","hash":"purpose_and_significance","id":1},{"text":"Usage","hash":"usage","id":2}]},"74":{"id":74,"text":"A contract ABI is a representation of a Starknet contract interface.

allowing more flexibility on the events that can be emitted from a given contract. For example: It is no longer enforced that the Event enum variants are structs of the same name as the variant, they can now be a struct or an enum of any name. Enum variants inside event ABI entries (entries in the abi with \"type\": \"event\" and \"kind\": \"enum\") now have two possible kinds. Before v2.3.0 it was always \"kind\": \"nested\", now \"kind: \"flat\" is also possible. v2.3.0 is backward compatible with version ≥ 2.0.0 ABI, so the same structure of the ABI is kept, while allowing flexibility. Between versions v2.0.0 and v2.2.0, to identify all potential serializations of events (what raw keys, data arrays can be emitted given the ABI), it was sufficient to iterate over the abi entries with \"type\": \"event\" and \"kind\": \"struct\", skipping the encapsulating Event type which has \"kind\": \"enum\". With v2.3.0 onwards, doing so may result in losing information. To illustrate this, consider the following example: //high-level code defining the events #[event] #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] enum Event { ComponentEvent: test_component::Event, TestCounterIncreased: CounterIncreased, TestCounterDecreased: CounterDecreased, TestEnum: MyEnum } #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] struct CounterIncreased { amount: u128 } #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] struct CounterDecreased { amount: u128 } #[derive(Copy, Drop, starknet::Event)] enum MyEnum { Var1: MyStruct } #[derive(Copy, Drop, Serde, starknet::Event)] struct MyStruct { member: u128 } In v2.3.0 enum variant types can now have any name. As an example the TestCounterIncreased variant and the CounterIncreased type, as they appear in the ABI: { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"::Event\", \"kind\": \"enum\", \"variants\": [ { \"name\": \"ComponentEvent\", \"type\": \"::test_component::Event\", \"kind\": \"nested\" }, { \"name\": \"TestCounterIncreased\", \"type\": \"::CounterIncreased\", \"kind\": \"nested\" }, { \"name\": \"TestCounterDecreased\", \"type\": \"::CounterDecreased\", \"kind\": \"nested\" }, { \"name\": \"TestEnum\", \"type\": \"::MyEnum\", \"kind\": \"nested\" } ] }, { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"::CounterIncreased\", \"kind\": \"struct\", \"members\": [ { \"name\": \"amount\", \"type\": \"core::integer::u128\", \"kind\": \"data\" } ] } When the contract emits the TestCounterIncreased event, for example by writing self.emit(CounterIncreased { amount })), the event that is emitted has the following keys and data: One key based on the variant name: sn_keccak(TestCounterIncreased). This information only appears in the ::Event type entry in the ABI, as the name TestCounterIncreased does not appear in the \"kind\": \"struct\" ABI entry. This did not matter in previous versions when the variant name and type had to be equal. One data element based on the struct CounterIncreased which is associated with TestCounterIncreased via one of the Event type variants. The introduction of components allows variants of Event to be enums. In the following example, we have two such variants: TestEnum (unrelated to components) and ComponentEvent. The serialization to keys and data is the same in both cases, so this example will focus on TestEnum: This example shows the TestEnum variant entry inside Event: { \"name\": \"TestEnum\", \"type\": \"::MyEnum\", \"kind\": \"nested\" } This example shows the MyEnum event entry: { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"::MyEnum\", \"kind\": \"enum\", \"variants\": [ { \"name\": \"Var1\", \"type\": \"::MyStruct\", \"kind\": \"nested\" } ] } This example shows the MyStruct event entry: { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"::MyStruct\", \"kind\": \"struct\", \"members\": [ { \"name\": \"member\", \"type\": \"core::integer::u128\", \"kind\": \"data\" } ] } If a TestEnum event is being emitted via self.emit(Event::TestEnum(MyEnum::Var1(MyStruct {member: 5}))), you can implement the trait Into to avoid having to write it out in full. When the event is emitted, the serialization to keys and data happens as follows: Since the TestEnum variant has kind nested, add the first key: sn_keccak(TestEnum), and the rest of the serialization to keys and data is done recursively via the starknet::event trait implementation of MyEnum. Next, you can handle a \"kind\": \"nested\" variant (previously it was TestEnum, now it’s Var1), which means you can add another key depending on the sub-variant: sn_keccak(Var1), and proceed to serialize according to the starknet::event implementation of MyStruct. Finally, proceed to serialize MyStruct, which gives us a single data member. This results in keys = [sn_keccak(TestEnum), sn_keccak(Var1)] and data=[5] Allowing variants that are themselves enums (TestEnum is an enum variant here) means further nesting is possible. For example, if the high level code is changed to: #[event] #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] enum Event { ComponentEvent: test_component::Event, TestCounterIncreased: CounterIncreased, TestCounterDecreased: CounterDecreased, TestEnum: MyEnum } #[derive(Copy, Drop, starknet::Event)] enum MyEnum { Var1: AnotherEnum } #[derive(Copy, Drop, Serde, starknet::Event)] enum AnotherEnum { Var2: MyStruct } #[derive(Copy, Drop, Serde, starknet::Event)] struct MyStruct { member: u128, } then self.emit(Event::TestEnum(MyEnum::Var1(AnotherEnum::Var2(MyStruct { member: 5 })))) (as before, Into implementations can shorten this) will emit an event with keys = [sn_keccak(TestEnum), sn_keccak(Var1), sn_keccak(Var2)] and data=[5]. This will look as follows in the ABI (only the relevant parts are shown): { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"::Event\", \"kind\": \"enum\", \"variants\": [ // ignoring all the other variants for brevity { \"name\": \"TestEnum\", \"type\": \"::MyEnum\", \"kind\": \"nested\" } ] }, { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"::MyEnum\", \"kind\": \"enum\", \"variants\": [ { \"name\": \"Var1\", \"type\": \"::AnotherEnum\", \"kind\": \"nested\" } ] }, { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"::AnotherEnum\", \"kind\": \"enum\", \"variants\": [ { \"name\": \"Var2\", \"type\": \"::MyStruct\", \"kind\": \"nested\" } ] } As TestEnum, Var1 and Var2 are of kind nested, a selector should be added to the list of keys, before continuing to recursively serialize. You might not want to nest enums when serializing the event. For example, if you write an ERC-20 as a component, not a contract, that is pluggable anywhere, you might not want the contract to modify the keys of known events such as Transfer. To avoid nesting, write the following high level code: #[event] #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] enum Event { ComponentEvent: test_component::Event, TestCounterIncreased: CounterIncreased, TestCounterDecreased: CounterDecreased, #[flat] TestEnum: MyEnum } By writing the above, the TestEnum variant entry in the ABI will change to: { \"name\": \"TestEnum\", \"type\": \"::MyEnum\", \"kind\": \"flat\" } This means that self.emit(Event::TestEnum(MyEnum::Var1(MyStruct {member: 5}))) will emit an event with keys=[sn_keccak(Var1)] and data=[5]. With the transition to v2.0.0, the contract ABI underwent some changes. Consider the following high level code that generates the ABI in the following example: #[starknet::interface] trait IOtherContract { fn decrease_allowed(self: @TContractState) -> bool; } #[starknet::interface] trait ICounterContract { fn increase_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128); fn decrease_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128); fn get_counter(self: @TContractState) -> u128; } #[starknet::contract] mod counter_contract { use starknet::ContractAddress; use super::{ IOtherContractDispatcher, IOtherContractDispatcherTrait, IOtherContractLibraryDispatcher }; #[storage] struct Storage { counter: u128, other_contract: IOtherContractDispatcher } #[event] #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] enum Event { CounterIncreased: CounterIncreased, CounterDecreased: CounterDecreased } #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] struct CounterIncreased { amount: u128 } #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] struct CounterDecreased { amount: u128 } #[constructor] fn constructor( ref self: ContractState, initial_counter: u128, other_contract_addr: ContractAddress ) { self.counter.write(initial_counter); self .other_contract .write(IOtherContractDispatcher { contract_address: other_contract_addr }); } #[external(v0)] impl CounterContract of super::ICounterContract { fn get_counter(self: @ContractState) -> u128 { self.counter.read() } fn increase_counter(ref self: ContractState, amount: u128) { let current = self.counter.read(); self.counter.write(current + amount); self.emit(CounterIncreased { amount }); } fn decrease_counter(ref self: ContractState, amount: u128) { let allowed = self.other_contract.read().decrease_allowed(); if allowed { let current = self.counter.read(); self.counter.write(current - amount); self.emit(CounterDecreased { amount }); } } } } Since the CounterContract impl is annotated with the #[external(v0)] attribute, you’ll find the following impl entry in the ABI: { \"type\": \"impl\", \"name\": \"CounterContract\", \"interface_name\": \"new_syntax_test_contract::new_syntax_test_contract::ICounterContract\" } ---- This means that every function appearing in the ICounterContract interface is a possible entry point of the contract. Standalone functions in the contract outside an external impl can also be annotated with #[external(v0)] (currently, this is the only way to add L1 handlers). In such cases, a corresponding function (or l1_handler) entry will be found in the ABI in the same hierarchy as impls and interfaces. In Cairo v2, a dedicated type for the contract’s events was introduced. Currently, the contract event type must be an enum named Event, whose variants are structs of the same name as the variant. Types that can be emitted via self.emit(_) must implement the Event trait, which defines how this type should be serialized into two felt252 arrays, keys and data. The Event enum variants appear in the ABI under \"type\" = \"event\" rather than regular structs. For such entries, each member has an additional kind field that specifies how the serialization into keys and data takes place: If the kind is key, then this member or variant are serialized into the event’s keys. If the kind is data, then this member or variant are serialized into the event’s data. If the kind is nested, then the member or variant are serialized according to the Event attribute, potentially adding to both keys and data. This feature is not yet supported, so no high level code written in Cairo v2.0.0 can generate such an ABI. You can find a JSON schema specification of the ABI in the starknet-specs repository. For a UI-friendly version, you can use the OPEN-RPC playground.","title":"Contract ABI","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"contract-abi","url":"/architecture-and-concepts/smart-contracts/contract-abi/","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"introduction","id":1},{"text":"An example contract ABI","hash":"an_example_contract_abi","id":2},{"text":"Cairo v2.3.0 changes","hash":"cairo_v2_3_0_changes","id":3},{"text":"Nested events","hash":"nested_events","id":4},{"text":"Variant names different from types","hash":"variant_names_different_from_types","id":5},{"text":"Enum variants inside Event","hash":"enum_variants_inside_event","id":6},{"text":"Flattened enum variants","hash":"flattened_enum_variants","id":7},{"text":"Cairo v2.0.0 changes","hash":"cairo_v2_0_0_changes","id":8},{"text":"Interface and Impl ABI entries","hash":"interface_and_impl_abi_entries","id":9},{"text":"Events","hash":"events","id":10},{"text":"Specification","hash":"specification","id":11}]},"75":{"id":75,"text":"The contract address is a unique identifier of the contract on Starknet.

A contract class is the definition of a contract. It includes Cairo byte code, hint information, entry point names, and everything that defines its semantics. Each class is uniquely identified by its class hash, comparable to a class name in traditional object-oriented programming languages. A contract instance is a deployed contract that corresponds to a class. Only contract instances act as true contracts, in that they have their own storage and can be called by transactions or other contracts. A contract class does not necessarily have a deployed instance in Starknet. A contract class does not necessarily require a deployed instance in Starknet. A contract instance has a nonce, the value of which is the number of transactions originating from this address plus 1. For example, when you deploy an account with a DEPLOY_ACCOUNT transaction, the nonce of the account contract in the transaction is 0. After the DEPLOY_ACCOUNT transaction, until the account contract sends its next transaction, the nonce is 1. Adding new classes To introduce new classes to Starknet’s state, use the DECLARE transaction. Deploying instances To deploy a new instance of a previously declared class, use the deploy system call. Using class functionality To use the functionality of a declared class without deploying an instance, use the library_call system call.

The storage is a map with \\(2^{251}\\) slots, where each slot is a felt which is initialized to 0. The basic function for writing to storage writes, value to key is: storage_write_syscall(address_domain, address, value) storage_read is a basic function that is used for getting the storage address, this function is created by the compiler when defining a storage variable, as explained below. This function returns the address of the storage variable. Below we discuss how this address is determined from the variable’s name and keys. Both storage_read and storage_write are system calls that can be imported by adding the line: use starknet::syscalls::storage_read_syscall; use starknet::syscalls::storage_write_syscall; The most common way to interact with a contract’s storage is through storage variables. The #[storage] attribute above the Storage struct declares that the contents of this struct are part of the contract storage. The storage variables stored inside this struct can consist of a single felt, or it can be a mapping from multiple arguments to a tuple of felts or structs. To use this variable, the var.read(args), var.write(args, value) and var.address(args) functions are automatically created by the #[storage] attribute, for reading the storage value, writing the storage value and getting the storage address, respectively. The Starknet contract compiler generates the Cairo code that maps the storage variable’s name and argument values to an address — so that it can be part of the generated proof. The address of a storage variable is computed as follows: If it is a single value, then the address is sn_keccak(variable_name), where variable_name is the ASCII encoding of the variable’s name. If it is a (nested) mapping, then the address of the value at key k_1,...,k_n is h(...h(h(sn_keccak(variable_name),k_1),k_2),...,k_n) where \\(h\\) is the Pedersen hash and the final value is taken \\(\\bmod 2^{251}-256\\) If it is a mapping to complex values (e.g., tuples or structs), then this complex value lies in a continuous segment starting from the address calculated in the previous point. Note that 256 field elements is the current limitation on the maximal size of a complex storage value. Note that when calling var.address(args) for a storage variable with complex values, the returned value is the address of the first element in the storage. We can summarize the above as follows: storage variable address := pedersen(keccak(variable name), keys) The following example defines storage variables with complex values. #[storage] struct Storage { name: felt252, symbol: felt252, decimals: u8, total_supply: u256, balances: LegacyMap::, allowances: LegacyMap::, }","title":"Contract storage","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"contract-storage","url":"/architecture-and-concepts/smart-contracts/contract-storage/","titles":[{"text":"Storage layout","hash":"storage_layout","id":1},{"text":"Storage low level functions","hash":"storage_low_level_functions","id":2},{"text":"Storage variables","hash":"storage_variables","id":3}]},"78":{"id":78,"text":"With the v2.0.0 release of the Cairo compiler, the Starknet contract syntax has evolved, affecting the organization of functions, storage, and events. For more information on the latest syntax changes, see the Community Forum post Cairo 1: Contract Syntax is Evolving. Prerequisites A contract written with the Cairo compiler v1 The most recent version of the Cairo compiler Procedure Change the contract annotation from #[contract] to #[starknet::contract]. For example:: Cairo v1 Cairo v2 #[contract] mod CounterContract { ... } #[starknet::contract] mod CounterContract { ... } Annotate the Storage struct with the #[storage] attribute. For example: Cairo v1 Cairo v2 struct Storage { counter: u128, other_contract: IOtherContractDispatcher } #[storage] struct Storage { counter: u128, other_contract: IOtherContractDispatcher } Gather your contract’s external and view function signatures under a trait annotated with #[starknet::interface] as follows: Add a generic parameter to the trait. In the following example, the name TContractState represents the state of your contract. For view functions, add the self: @TContractState argument. For external functions, add the ref self: TContractState argument. Static functions that do not touch storage or emit events do not require an additional argument. For example: Cairo v1 Cairo v2 #[contract] mod CounterContract { #[external] fn increase_counter(amount: u128) { ... } #[external] fn decrease_counter(amount: u128) { ... } #[view] fn get_counter() -> u128 { ... } } #[starknet::interface] trait ICounterContract { fn increase_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128); fn decrease_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128); fn get_counter(self: @TContractState) -> u128; } #[starknet::contract] mod CounterContract { ... } Add the external and view function bodies under an impl of the interface trait, and mark the impl with the [external(v0)] attribute, which generates the type of dispatcher that is used to call the contract. For example: Cairo v1 Cairo v2 #[contract] mod CounterContract { #[external] fn increase_counter(amount: u128) { ... } #[external] fn decrease_counter(amount: u128) { ... } #[view] fn get_counter() -> u128 { ... } } #[starknet::interface] trait ICounterContract { fn increase_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128); fn decrease_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128); fn get_counter(self: @TContractState) -> u128; } #[starknet::contract] mod CounterContract { #[external(v0)] impl CounterContract of super::ICounterContract { fn increase_counter(ref self: ContractState, amount: u128) { ... } fn decrease_counter(ref self: ContractState, amount: u128) { ... } fn get_counter(self: @ContractState) -> u128 { ... } } } Replace the #[abi] attribute with #[starknet::interface]. While it doesn’t affect the generated code, adding to the trait a generic parameter T representing the contract’s state, and adding the ref self: T argument to external functions and self: @T argument for view functions makes the implementation more complete. For example: Cairo v1 Cairo v2 #[abi] trait IOtherContract { fn decrease_allowed() -> bool; } #[starknet::interface] trait IOtherContract { fn decrease_allowed(self: @TContractState) -> bool; } Modify storage accesses to happen through ContractState or @ContractState. No external functions in the contract that access storage also need to get it as an argument. For example: Cairo v1 Cairo v2 let current = counter::read(); let current = self.counter.read(); Unify all the contract’s events under the Event enum, and add a corresponding struct for every variant. All the structs must derive the Event trait, and each member type must implement the Serde trait. For example: Cairo v1 Cairo v2 #[event] fn counter_increased(amount: u128) {} #[event] fn counter_decreased(amount: u128) {} #[event] #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] enum Event { CounterIncreased: CounterIncreased, CounterDecreased: CounterDecreased } #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] struct CounterIncreased { amount: u128 } #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] struct CounterDecreased { amount: u128 } Emit events via the ContractState type. For example: Cairo v1 Cairo v2 fn increase_counter(amount: u128) { ... counter_increased(amount); } fn increase_counter(ref self: ContractState, amount: u128) { ... self.emit(Event::CounterIncreased(CounterIncreased { amount })); }","title":"Migrating a contract from Cairo v1 to Cairo v2","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"contract-syntax","url":"/architecture-and-concepts/smart-contracts/contract-syntax/","titles":[]},"79":{"id":79,"text":"For the most up-to-date information, see the info.cairo contract.

The field element (felt252), which contains 252 bits, is the only actual type in the Cairo VM. So all high-level Cairo types that are larger than 252 bits, such as u256 or arrays, are ultimately represented by a list of felts. In order to interact with a contract, you need to know how to encode its arguments as a list of felts so you can correctly formulate the calldata in the transaction. SDKs, such as starknet.js, encode the calldata for you, so you can simply specify any type and the SDK properly formulates the calldata. For example, you don’t need to know that a u256 value is represented by two felt252 values. You can simply specify a single integer in your code, and the SDK takes care of the serialization and encoding. The following types are smaller than 252 bits. For these types, each value is serialized as a single-member list that contains one felt252 value. ContractAddress EthAddress StorageAddress ClassHash Unsigned integers smaller than 252 bits: u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, and usize bytes31 felt252 Signed integers smaller than 252 bits: i8, i16, i32, i64, and i128. A negative value, \\(-x\\), is serialized as \\(P-x\\), where: \\[P = 2^{251} + 17*2^{192} + 1\\] For example, -5 is serialized as \\(P-5\\). For more information on the value of \\(P\\), see The STARK field. The following Cairo data types have non-trivial serialization: u256 and u512 arrays enums structs ByteArray, which represents strings Among unsigned integers, only u256 and u512 have non-trivial serialization. A u256 value in Cairo is represented by two felt252 values, as follows: The first felt252 value contains the 128 least significant bits, usually referred to as the low part of the original u256 value. The second felt252 value contains the 128 most significant bits, usually referred to as the high part of the original u256 value. For example: A u256 variable whose decimal value is 2 is serialized as [2,0]. To understand why, examine the binary representation of 2 and split it into two 128-bit parts, as follows: \\[\\underbrace{0\\cdots0}_{\\text{128 high bits}} | \\underbrace{0\\cdots10}_{\\text{128 low bits}}\\] A u256 variable whose decimal value is 2128 is serialized as [0,1]. To understand why, examine the binary representation of 2128 and split it into two 128-bit parts, as follows: \\[\\underbrace{0\\cdots01}_{\\text{128 high bits}} | \\underbrace{0\\cdots0}_{\\text{128 low bits}}\\] A u256 variable whose decimal value is 2129+2128+20, is serialized as [20,3]. To understand why, examine the binary representation of the 2129+2128+20 and split it into two 128-bit parts, as follows: \\[\\underbrace{0\\cdots011}_{\\text{128 high bits}} | \\underbrace{0\\cdots10100}_{\\text{128 low bits}}\\] The u512 type in Cairo is a struct containing four felt252 members, each representing a 128-bit limb of the original integer, similar to the u256 type. Arrays are serialized as follows: , ,…​, For example, consider the following array of u256 values: let POW_2_128: u256 = 0x100000000000000000000000000000000 let array: Array = array![10, 20, POW_2_128] Each u256 value in the array is represented by two felt252 values. So the array above is serialized as follows: \\[\\underbrace{3}_{\\textit{number_of_array_members}} , \\underbrace{10,0}_{\\textit{serialized_member_0}} , \\underbrace{20,0}_{\\textit{serialized_member_1}} , \\underbrace{0,1}_{\\textit{serialized_member_2}}\\] Combining the above, the array is serialized as follows: [3,10,0,20,0,0,1] An enum is serialized as follows: , Note that enum variants indices are 0-based, not to confuse with their storage layout, which is 1-based, to distinguish the first variant from an uninitialized storage slot. Enum serialization example 1 Consider the following definition of an enum named Week: enum Week { Sunday: (), // Index=0. The variant type is the unit type (0-tuple). Monday: u256, // Index=1. The variant type is u256. } Now consider instantiations of the Week enum’s variants as shown in the table below: Table 1. Serialization of Week variants Instance Description Serialization Week::Sunday Index=0. The variant’s type is the unit type. [0] Week::Monday(5) Index=1. The variant’s type is u256, hence serialized to [5,0], as shown in Serialization of u256 values . [1,5,0] Enum serialization example 2 Consider the following definition of an enum named MessageType: enum MessageType { A, #[default] B: u128, C } Now consider instantiations of the MessageType enum’s variants as shown in the table below: Table 2. Serialization of MessageType variants Instance Description Serialization MessageType::A Index=1. The variant’s type is the unit type. [0] MessageType::B(6) Index=0. The variant’s type is u128. [1,6] MessageType::C Index=2. The variant’s type is the unit type. [2] As you can see about, the #[default] attribute does not affect serialization. It only affects the storage layout of MessageType, where the default variant B will be stored as 0. You serialize a struct by serializing its members one at a time. Its members are serialized in the order in which they appear in the definition of the struct. For example, consider the following definition of the struct MyStruct: struct MyStruct { a: u256, b: felt252, c: Array } The serialization is the same for both of the following instantiations of the struct’s members: let my_struct = MyStruct { a: 2, b: 5, c: [1,2,3] }; let my_struct = MyStruct { b: 5, c: [1,2,3], a: 2 }; The serialization of MyStruct is determined as shown in the table Serialization for a struct in Cairo. Table 3. Serialization for a struct in Cairo Member Description Serialization a: 2 For information on serializing u256 values, see Serialization of u256 values [2,0] b: 5 One felt252 value 5 c: [1,2,3] An array of three felt252 values [3,1,2,3] Combining the above, the struct is serialized as follows: [2,0,5,3,1,2,3] A string is represented in Cairo as a ByteArray type. A byte array is actually a struct with the following members: data: Array Contains 31-byte chunks of the byte array. Each felt252 value has exactly 31 bytes. If the number of bytes in the byte array is less than 31, then this array is empty. pending_word: felt252 The bytes that remain after filling the data array with full 31-byte chunks. The pending word consists of at most 30 bytes. pending_word_len: usize The number of bytes in pending_word. Example 1: A string shorter than 31 characters Consider the string hello, whose ASCII encoding is the 5-byte hex value 0x68656c6c6f. The resulting byte array is serialized as follows: 0, // Number of 31-byte words in the data array. 0x68656c6c6f, // Pending word 5 // Length of the pending word, in bytes Example 2: A string longer than 31 bytes Consider the string Long string, more than 31 characters., which is represented by the following hex values: 0x4c6f6e6720737472696e672c206d6f7265207468616e203331206368617261 (31-byte word) 0x63746572732e (6-byte pending word) The resulting byte array is serialized as follows: 1, // Number of 31-byte words in the array construct. 0x4c6f6e6720737472696e672c206d6f7265207468616e203331206368617261, // 31-byte word. 0x63746572732e, // Pending word 6 // Length of the pending word, in bytes Integer types in The Cairo Programming Language.","title":"Serialization of Cairo types","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"serialization-of-cairo-types","url":"/architecture-and-concepts/smart-contracts/serialization-of-cairo-types/","titles":[{"text":"Data types of 252 bits or less","hash":"data_types_of_252_bits_or_less","id":1},{"text":"Data types greater than 252 bits","hash":"data_types_greater_than_252_bits","id":2},{"text":"Serialization of unsigned integers","hash":"serialization_of_unsigned_integers","id":3},{"text":"Serialization of u256 values","hash":"serialization_in_u256_values","id":4},{"text":"Serialization of u512 values","hash":"serialization_in_u512_values","id":5},{"text":"Serialization of arrays","hash":"serialization_of_arrays","id":6},{"text":"Serialization of enums","hash":"serialization_of_enums","id":7},{"text":"Serialization of structs","hash":"serialization_of_structs","id":8},{"text":"Serialization of byte arrays","hash":"serialization_of_byte_arrays","id":9},{"text":"Additional resources","hash":"additional_resources","id":10}]},"81":{"id":81,"text":"A contract may emit events throughout its execution. Each event contains the following fields: from_address: address of the contract emitting the events keys: a list of field elements data: a list of field elements The keys can be used for indexing the events, while the data may contain any information that we wish to log (note that we are dealing with two separate lists of possibly varying size, rather than a list of key-value pairs). Events can be defined in a contract using the @event decorator. Once an event E has been defined, the compiler automatically adds the function E.emit(). The following example illustrates how an event is defined and emitted: #[event] fn Transfer(from: ContractAddress, to: ContractAddress, value: u256) {} Transfer(12345, 12345, 1) The emit function emits an event with a single key, which is an identifier of the event, given by \\(\\text{sn_keccak}(event\\_name)\\), where \\(event\\_name\\) is the ASCII encoding of the event’s name and \\(\\text{sn_keccak}\\) is defined here. To emit custom keys, one should use the low level emit_event system call: use starknet::syscalls::emit_event_syscall; let keys = array!['key', 'deposit']; let values = array![1, 2, 3]; emit_event_syscall(keys, values).unwrap_syscall(); The above code emits an event with two keys, the strings key and deposit (think of those as identifiers of the event that can be used for indexing) and three data elements 1, 2, 3. When using the higher level emit syntax, the event’s data may be of complex types, for example: struct Point: member x : felt member y : felt end @event func message_received(arr_len : felt, arr: felt*, p: Point): end # ... let (data : felt*) = alloc() assert data[0] = 1 assert data[1] = 2 let p = Point(3,4) message_received.emit(2, data, p) The emitted events are part of the transaction receipt. For more information, see Transaction receipt. The event definition appears in the contract’s ABI. It contains the list of data fields, with the name and type for each, and the list of the custom keys, that is, all keys except the event identifier discussed above. Below is an example of an event inside the ABI: Example of an event in the ABI { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"Transfer\", \"inputs\": [ { \"name\": \"from\", \"type\": \"core::starknet::contract_address::ContractAddress\" }, { \"name\": \"to\", \"type\": \"core::starknet::contract_address::ContractAddress\" }, { \"name\": \"value\", \"type\": \"core::integer::u256\" } ] } The event hash is given by: \\[h(h(h(h(0,from\\_address),keys\\_hash),data\\_hash),3)\\] Where: \\(keys\\_hash\\) and \\(data\\_hash\\) are the hashes of the keys list and data list respectively.

These cover compilation, package management, testing and deployment. Scarb is a package manager for Cairo, but it is much more than that. It is the easiest and recommended way to build and maintain Cairo code. Think Cargo for Rust. Scarb is developed by Software Mansion. Scarb includes the following features: Initiating a new Cairo project. Compiling Cairo projects. Adding and removing Cairo dependencies. Generating Cairo documentation. Fetching and uploading packages Scarbs.xyz, the Cairo Registry. Integration with the Cairo Language Server It integrates with other tools in the Cairo ecosystem, such as Starknet Foundry and the Dojo gaming engine. GitHub: Scarb on GitHub Documentation: Scarb Docs Support: Scarb on Telegram Cairo Registry: scarbs.xyz Starknet Foundry is the go-to toolchain for developing Starknet smart contracts. Similarly to its EVM counterpart, Starknet Foundry supports a plethora of features focused on testing Cairo smart contracts for Starknet. Starknet Forge, and snforge_std allow the use of \"cheatcodes\" to test various aspects of the contracts. For example: Setting caller address Manipulating the timestamp and block number Forking the chain at a specific block and testing with that state Fuzz testing Getting accurate gas and resource reports Profiling Starknet Cast is a command line tool for interacting with the Starknet network, with deep integration with Starknet Foundry projects. With sncast it is possible to: Declare and deploy contracts Read from Starknet contracts Deploy accounts Interact with contracts GitHub: starknet-foundry on GitHub Documentation: starknet-foundry Docs Support: Starknet Foundry Support on Telegram Remix is a browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) for Ethereum that you can use for learning, experimenting and finding vulnerabilities in smart contracts, without installing anything. The Starknet Remix plugin lets you use Remix for testing Starknet smart contracts, so you can focus on learning Cairo and Starknet in the comfort of your browser. Remix and the Starknet Remix plugin include the following features: Integrated compiling. You can deploy contracts to testnet, mainnet and the plugin’s own integrated devnet. You can call functions of contracts that you have already deployed, to facilitate testing and interaction. The Starknet Remix Plugin is integrated with Starknet By Example, a rich repository of practical learning content. Remix Project: Remix Project site.

The Universal Sierra Compiler supports all sierra versions, and can compile the the a CASM file. The USC comes bundled with Starknet Foundry and does not need to be installed separately if Starknet Foundry is installed. Universal Sierra Compiler on GitHub The Starknet RPC Request Builder is a useful tool to generate RPC queries for Starknet, with support for basic example for JavaScript, Go and Rust. RPC Request Builder The Open Zeppelin Contract Wizard is a tool that helps you create smart contracts with Open Zeppelin libraries. Easily toggle on and off features for popular smart contract patterns, and the wizard will generate the code for you. Open Zeppelin Contract Wizard Cairo-profiler can be used to create profiles of Cairo executions from execution traces. These can be analyzed and displayed to show Flame Graphs, and other useful information. Cairo-profiler is currently integrated into Starknet Foundry, but can be used as a standalone tool. Cairo Profiler on GitHub If want to dive deep into the Cairo VM, and experiment writing Cairo online, and don’t want to deploy a smart contract on Starknet, the Cairo Playground is a great way to do so. Cairo Playground A JavaScript package, abstracting the Starknet Devnet API, making it easier to interact with starknet-devnet-rs. This simplifies writing end-to-end tests using Devnet, including tests for L1<>L2 communications.
